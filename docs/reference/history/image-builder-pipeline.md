# image.builder.pipeline — project history

!!! note "Frozen archive — retired 2026-09-10"

    This is `CHANGELOG.md` from
    [ericcames/image.builder.pipeline](https://github.com/ericcames/image.builder.pipeline)
    as it stood when the per-PR changelog obligation was retired
    ([image.builder.pipeline#119](https://github.com/ericcames/image.builder.pipeline/issues/119)).
    Nothing is appended to it again.

    **Bare issue numbers refer to `ericcames/image.builder.pipeline`.** They do
    not autolink on this site — read `(#112)` as
    `https://github.com/ericcames/image.builder.pipeline/issues/112`. References
    to `sales.demos` are written out in full.

    Entries are verbatim and newest first. For anything after 2026-09-10, see
    [where things live now](README.md).

### Fixed
- **The Windows row said "built and published" with a caveat that the tag's
  hardening had not been re-verified. It had been, and thoroughly (#112).**
  `win2k22-cis-l1-golden:20260908-1853` measures 10 of 10 controls impossible on
  a clean install -- off the media *and* off the booted guest's own disk -- and
  **27 of 27 (100%)** across the full set on a clone confirmed rebuilt from the
  DataSource serving that image (sales.demos#358, #382). The row now says
  **Complete**.
- **The caveat was written from the artifact and the label, and missed the
  record.** `skopeo inspect` and a green consumer scan genuinely prove nothing,
  which is what I checked; the verification lives in sales.demos' CHANGELOG and
  in `playbooks/scripts/verify_cis_disk.py`, which runs inside the publish and
  **refuses to apply an L1 label the disk does not support**. The label is a gate
  output, not an assertion -- that is what changed after #91, and it is the part
  the previous wording missed.
- The two genuine non-evidence points are kept, because both still look like
  proof: a green `Windows Day 1 - 4 Compliance Scan` (the consumer's
  `windows_compliance_fail_on_noncompliant` defaults to `false`, so it reports
  rather than gates) and a bare `cis.level=L1` label, which is exactly what #91
  was.
- Also records that `sysprep /generalize` strips nothing, measured off the
  sysprepped guest's disk.

### Changed
- **The platform table said Windows Server 2022 was "Phase 3", and the tag it
  points at has been in production use for days (#112).** Every task that row
  depends on is Done in `ROADMAP.md` — unattended install, ISO remaster (#40),
  CIS L1 hardening over WinRM with 44 controls, sysprep and publish — and
  `sales.demos` consumes the published tag. "Phase 3" understated it.
- **It does not say "Complete" either, and that is the point.** The RHEL 9 row
  quotes a score because one exists (OpenSCAP 98.07 against a 95 gate). Windows
  has no equivalent yet, so the row says **built and published** and links to a
  short section explaining exactly what is and is not evidenced.
- **Three things that look like proof and are not**, now written down so the
  question is not re-litigated:
    - **The `cis.level=L1` label.** That is the label #91 was about: it was
      present on `20260907-0516` while the disk underneath was the unhardened
      Sep 5 build, and the guest scored 9 of 27.
    - **A green `Windows Day 1 - 4 Compliance Scan`.** The consumer's
      `windows_compliance_fail_on_noncompliant` defaults to `false` — the scan
      is a report, not a gate, deliberately, so a red node never appears in
      front of a customer. Job 591 succeeded on 2026-09-09 and would have
      succeeded at 9 of 27 too.
    - **The layer size.** 5,438,513,415 bytes is a compressed layer; the
      known-bad artifact was a 9,307,619,328-byte uncompressed qcow2. Not
      comparable either way.
- **What is actually known**, and is now in the README: the current tag was built
  **sixty-one minutes after the #91 fix landed** (`dd8116b`, 2026-09-08 17:52:31
  UTC; image created 18:53:28 UTC), so it is the first publish with the
  stale-`creates:` path removed. The section names the one command that would
  turn "published" into "verified".
- **`## Quay.io private repo entitlement` was a troubleshooting write-up for a
  resolved problem** — the free plan's zero private-repo allowance, a screenshot
  of the Quay warning banner, and instructions to open a support case. The
  Unlimited Repositories subscription is active to 2027-08-14. It is now a
  two-row table saying which image is public, which is private, and why; the
  lapse runbook and the screenshot moved to `docs/operations.md` rather than
  being deleted.
- **`sales.demos#3` was described as "shipped and waiting on a tag".** It has
  the tag and consumes it.
- **`### Working across both repos` was ~30 lines near-duplicated in
  `sales.demos`' README.** Cut to the part specific to this repo — that its
  skills are not reachable from a session started elsewhere — with a link to the
  canonical copy. Two copies with nothing keeping them in step had already begun
  to drift, which is the same problem ericcames/sales.demos-docs#12 was opened
  for.

### Changed
- **Getting started opened with AWS prerequisites, but most readers only consume
  what this repo publishes (#114).** The README already says four lines above it
  that this repo is the producer and the dependency runs outward — Getting
  started did not act on that. It now opens with three doors: consuming the
  images (you do not need this repo — go to `sales.demos`), building or
  publishing one (the previous content, pipeline commands unchanged), and
  working across both repos. Mirrors the shape applied in sales.demos#418.
- **The cross-repo working shape is now stated, and it points away from here.**
  A session spanning both repos must start in `sales.demos`, because its
  `.mcp.json` is project-scoped and **this repo has no MCP servers at all**. From
  there you can `cd` here and run these playbooks, since the working directory
  does not restrict shell access — better in one direction only. The new
  `### Working across both repos` subsection also says plainly that **this
  repo's skills are not reachable from that session**: `first-time`,
  `dev-workflow`, `rhel9-containerdisk` and `windows-image-build` are discovered
  only from a session started here, so `/first-time` typed over there gets
  nothing.
- **The `git clone` step was missing.** Getting started began at `claude .` with
  no instruction to obtain the repo first.
- **The by-hand fallback is now specific instead of reassuring.** It said the
  skill "reads perfectly well as a checklist"; it now names the Step 0 audit as
  the plain shell block to paste, which is the part that actually is one.
  Claude Code stays named as the primary path — deliberately not "your favorite
  AI agent", which would be false, since other agents do not discover
  `.claude/skills/`.

### Added
- **Issue chooser (#111).** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` sets
  `blank_issues_enabled: false` and adds contact links to the roadmap, the
  operational runbook, the security policy, and `sales.demos` for anyone whose
  question is about *consuming* an image rather than building one.
  `bug_report.md` and `feature_request.md` already existed, but GitHub offered
  "Open a blank issue" beside them, so people took it.
- **`.github/CODEOWNERS` (#111).** There was none, so no review was ever
  auto-requested on a PR. `sales.demos` has had one; this repo now matches.
- **LVMS operator Day 0 manifest (#97).** `sno-manifests/lvms/` adds the
  `lvms-operator` Subscription so fresh SNO installs get a StorageClass out of
  the box. Needed for Compliance Operator scan PVCs and VM disks.
- **Root partition sizing (#97, corrected by #101).** New MachineConfig template
  (`98-lvms-partition`) reserves the tail of the boot disk for LVMS by declaring
  a partition that starts at `sno_root_partition_size_gb` (default 200 GB), which
  is what caps root. Without this, RHCOS grows root to fill the disk and LVMS has
  nothing to use. Set to 0 to disable.

### Changed
- **README opens with what the factory is for, not how it works (#111).** It
  led with *"This pipeline automates four stages"* -- accurate, and it told a
  reader nothing about who the repo is for or what they get. Replaced with a
  value-first executive summary and an at-a-glance table
  (For / Produces / Run it / Status). The four-stage list is unchanged, now
  under `## Overview`.
- **`Quick Start` is now `Getting started`, and it moved (#111).** It sat fifth,
  about 55 lines down, behind Overview, Architecture, Supported platforms and
  the skills table -- so the section a new operator needs first was the last one
  they reached. It now follows the executive summary directly, matching
  `sales.demos` and `sales.demos-docs`. `Prerequisites` folded in beneath it as
  `### Prerequisites` rather than standing alone before it.
- **Getting started leads with the `first-time` skill (#111).** The skill was
  listed in the Claude skills table but never referenced from the setup path,
  so the one thing that validates every local prerequisite was invisible to
  someone actually setting up.
- **`.github/pull_request_template.md` renamed to
  `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (#111).** Both work -- GitHub is
  case-insensitive here -- but `sales.demos` used the uppercase form and the
  inconsistency invited the question of which one is correct. Content unchanged.
- `## Supported Platforms` is now `## Supported platforms`, so the anchor the
  new at-a-glance table links to resolves.
- **Default cluster name changed from `demo` to `edge` (#97).** Base domain
  changed from `example.com` to `internal.ames.net`. Aligns with the
  `sales.demos` inventory environment name and avoids collision with the RHDP
  `demo` environment.
- **OCP channel bumped from `stable-4.17` to `stable-4.22` (#97).** Matches
  the proven NUC install (OCP 4.22.13).

### Fixed
- **The SNO root partition still filled the disk (#101).** The Day 0
  MachineConfig sized partition 4 directly. Ignition did that correctly — and
  `ignition-ostree-growfs` ran a second later and grew it back, because
  `growpart` expands root into any free space that follows it. Measured on the
  NUC: Ignition set 419430400 sectors (200 GiB), growfs logged
  `CHANGED: partition=4 ... new: size=1999358607`. Sizing root was never the
  right lever. The template now declares partition 5 at that offset instead, so
  `growpart` is bounded by it. Verified on the rebuilt NUC: `sda4` 199.5 GiB,
  `sda5` 753.9 GiB, 1007 KiB free.

  **`growpart` still logs `CHANGED` — that is the fix working, not the bug
  (#104).** An earlier draft of this entry said it would report NOCHANGE; root is
  written at ~9 GiB, so it does grow, just no further than partition 5. Tell them
  apart by the end sector, not the word: `end=2000409230` is the bug (end of
  disk), `end=419430399` is correct (stops at partition 5).

  This also fixes a second defect that would have survived the first: the design
  doc claimed LVMS auto-discovers unallocated *space*. It discovers unused block
  **devices**, and skips devices with children, so `/dev/sda` was never eligible.
  Partition 5 is left unformatted and unmounted so LVMS claims it with no
  `deviceSelector` change in `install_lvms.yml`.
- **SNO Day 0 manifest errors found during NUC boot (#95).** Four issues
  blocked or delayed the first ABI ISO bootstrap: (1) AAP subscription used
  package name `aap-operator` instead of `ansible-automation-platform-operator`,
  (2) CNV was missing a Namespace manifest — `openshift-cnv` does not exist by
  default, (3) CNV was missing an OperatorGroup manifest, (4) the
  `ScanSettingBinding` cannot be a Day 0 manifest because the Compliance
  Operator CRD does not exist during bootstrap, causing bootkube to retry
  indefinitely and block the pivot. Fixed by correcting the package name,
  adding CNV namespace and operatorgroup manifests, and moving the
  ScanSettingBinding to Day 1 documentation.
- **The #92 gate looked for a control where it cannot exist (#93).**
  `verify_cis_disk.py` checked `DisableWebPnPDownload` at
  `\Policies\Microsoft\Windows`; the CIS role writes it to
  `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Nt\Printers` (rule 18.9.20.1.1,
  `level1-memberserver`, enabled). The path omitted both `Nt` and `\Printers`,
  so the value could not be found on any machine. **It was invisible because the
  only disk ever measured was unhardened**, where the honest answer and the bug
  are both `VALUE ABSENT` — the same failure shape as #91 one level up, with the
  *checker* validated against an artifact that could not tell a pass from a bug.
  Caught the first time genuinely hardened media was read, which returned 9 of 10.
  Key paths now also resolve case-insensitively; regipy already does this, so it
  is belt-and-braces against an undocumented behaviour, not load-bearing. The
  same defect is fixed in `sales.demos` #370, which this reader was ported from.

### Added
- **The Windows CIS level is now measured, not declared (#91).**
  `playbooks/scripts/verify_cis_disk.py` reads the `SOFTWARE` and `SYSTEM` hives
  out of the qcow2 a publish is about to package — `qemu-img`, `ntfscat` and
  `regipy`, with no root, no libguestfs, no cluster and no booting the guest —
  and checks ten CIS controls that cannot be set on a clean install, so a pass
  cannot be a Windows default in disguise. `publish_windows_containerdisk.yml`
  refuses to apply `com.redhat.cis.level=L1` unless the disk supports it, and
  fails equally when the check cannot reach a verdict, because "unverified" is
  the state that let #91 ship. A preflight check fails in a second if `regipy`
  is missing rather than forty minutes into the download. The verdict lands in
  `cis_verify.json` and in `publish_output.json` beside the level being claimed;
  the script also reports the disk's sysprep count and dates, which is how #91
  was caught. Ported from `sales.demos` `utilities/inspect-golden-image.py`.
  `-e cis_level=none` publishes unhardened media ungated and says so out loud.
- **Phase 5: OpenShift SNO installer kit (#86).** Agent-Based Installer ISO
  pipeline for bare-metal Single Node OpenShift with AAP 2.7, OpenShift
  Virtualization, Compliance Operator, and CIS L1 node hardening as Day 0
  manifests. Initial scaffolding: `build_sno_installer.yml` playbook, Jinja2
  templates for `install-config.yaml` and `agent-config.yaml`, Day 0 operator
  manifests (AAP, CNV, Compliance Operator), `generate-iso.sh` script,
  `sno_defaults.yml`, ROADMAP Phase 5, and `docs/design.md` §11.

### Fixed
- **A publish repackaged a previous run's disk, and labelled it CIS L1 (#91).**
  `publish_windows_containerdisk.yml` guarded the qcow2 conversion with
  `creates: disk.qcow2` while its cleanup deleted only `disk.img.gz` and
  `disk.raw` — so a qcow2 survived between runs and the next publish skipped the
  conversion and packaged the stale disk. `win2k22-cis-l1-golden:20260907-0516`
  is the 2026-09-05 unhardened build, byte-identical to
  `win2k22-golden:20260905-2217` at 9307619328 bytes, and the demo guest built
  from it scored 9 of 27 CIS controls (`sales.demos#358`). Both `creates:`
  guards are gone, intermediates are purged before the run starts, `disk.qcow2`
  and the verification scratch are removed in the `always:` block as
  `build_cis_containerdisk.yml` has always done, and the packaged qcow2 is
  asserted to be newer than the run that packaged it. The cluster was never at
  fault — the export selected the correct, freshly built PVC.
- **CIS controls that break WinRM mid-hardening (#79).** Disabled four controls
  in `cis_profile.yml` that kill the WinRM session during the build:
  `win22cis_rule_2_3_17_1` and `_2` (UAC Admin Approval Mode — NTLM credentials
  rejected), `win22cis_rule_18_9_19_4` and `_5` (security policy background
  refresh — triggers immediate reprocessing of all security settings, dropping
  the connection). Not covered by the role's `win_skip_for_test`. Also added a
  `fail:` task in Play 3 so a lost WinRM connection fails the build instead of
  exiting 0.
- **Edge AppX package blocks sysprep after CIS hardening (#79).** CIS
  hardening installs or updates Microsoft Edge as a per-user AppX package.
  Sysprep refuses to generalize with per-user packages not provisioned for all
  users (`0x80073cf2`). Added an AppX cleanup step after CIS and before sysprep.
- **Port-forward dies mid-CIS hardening (#79).** kubectl port-forward uses a
  WebSocket that OpenShift drops after ~15 minutes. The CIS role takes ~15
  minutes. Wrapped the port-forward in a keepalive loop that restarts it
  automatically; WinRM reconnects on the next task. Eliminates the need to
  re-run the playbook when the tunnel drops.

### Documentation
- **How the Windows CIS claim is evidenced (#91).** `docs/design.md` §10.2 now
  states that `com.redhat.cis.level` is an observation of the disk rather than
  an input to the publish, and §10.5 splits compliance evidence by OS. The
  section previously deferred per-format scanning on the grounds that "the same
  profile applied to the same distribution produces the same compliance posture
  regardless of output format" — true for RHEL, where Image Builder runs
  OpenSCAP, and false for Windows, which has no compose and no scan and was
  taking the operator's intent as evidence.
- **CIS L1 image verified end-to-end (#84).** Updated `docs/design.md` §10.2 to
  reflect that `win2k22-cis-l1-golden:20260907-0516` is published and consumed.
  `win_ping` from AAP returned `ok: 1` against a clone provisioned from the CIS
  image (`sales.demos` #270, #294). Removed stale "until PR 2" references.

### Changed
- **Worktrees mandatory for code changes (#77).** Strengthened CLAUDE.md from
  defensive habits only to an unconditional worktree rule — the main checkout
  stays on `main` as read-only. Matches `sales.demos` #267.

### Added
- **CIS L1 Member Server hardening in the Windows build (#24 PR 2).** `build_windows_image.yml` now applies `ansible-lockdown/Windows-2022-CIS` to the build VM over WinRM before sysprep. Default is `windows_cis_harden=true`. Three plays: install, harden, cleanup. The hardening profile forces non-cloud lockout order (`hosted_virtual_system_override: false`) to avoid the secedit failure on KubeVirt, and `win_skip_for_test: true` skips 11 controls that would kill WinRM mid-run. Verified 2026-09-06: 44 controls applied, idempotent on re-run.
- **`playbooks/vars/cis_profile.yml`** — CIS role configuration extracted to a vars file. Documents the KubeVirt auto-detect bug and the 11 skipped controls with reasons.
- **`roles/requirements.yml`** — installs the CIS role from `ansible-lockdown/Windows-2022-CIS`.
- **`collections/requirements.yml` gains `ansible.windows`, `community.windows`, `community.general`** — the CIS role's dependencies, pinned to the versions verified against.
- **`publish_windows_containerdisk.yml` now defaults to `cis_level=L1` and `win2k22-cis-l1-golden`**, matching the build default. Override both with `-e cis_level=none` and `QUAY_WINDOWS_REPO` for unhardened builds.

### Changed
- **`windows_sysprep_at_first_logon` defaults to `false`** (was `true`). The build now syspreps via WinRM after hardening rather than from the answer file. Pass `-e windows_cis_harden=false -e windows_sysprep_at_first_logon=true` for the old PR 1 behavior.

### Fixed
- **README: corrected Quay.io repo visibility (#73).** The pipeline diagram said `Quay.io (private)` but the RHEL CIS containerDisk repo is public — only the Windows repo is private. Added a Quay.io private repo entitlement section with screenshot documenting that other SEs need at least a Developer plan or Red Hat developer subscription for private repos.
- **Removed hardcoded RHDP cluster ID from `build_windows_image.yml` (#64).** The demo-cluster guard defaulted `demo_cluster_marker` to a live cluster ID committed in a public repo. Now requires `demo_cluster_hostname` as an extra-var with no default — the build fails closed when it is absent, consistent with how `windows_eval_expires` is handled. The guard logic and override escape hatch are unchanged.
- **The cached answer file delete now works — Windows SMI was rejecting the CommandLine as too long (#69).** PR #70's single PowerShell command was 1031 characters; Windows SMI rejects `SynchronousCommand/CommandLine` values over ~1024 characters with error `0x80220005` during the oobeSystem pass, which invalidates the *entire* pass — AutoLogon, FirstLogonCommands, everything — dropping OOBE to the manual region screen. Split into three short commands (Orders 5–7, each under 410 chars): delete+log, cleanup other locations, and assert. Root cause diagnosed by parsing `UnattendGC\setupact.log` off the raw NTFS disk.

### Added
- **The post-#59 rebuild reproduces the measured build time, so the fix is free (#63).** Rebuilt on `cluster-kbjvc` 2026-09-05, teardown of the spoiled namespace through to a `Stopped` generalized VM: **21m25s**, against the **21m26s** measured in #56. One second apart on an unattended 21-minute build is the same number twice, which is what makes it a measurement rather than an anecdote — n=2 on the figure `ROADMAP.md` quotes. The guest phase reproduces on its own too: the power-off watch took **31 polls at 30s ≈ 16m**, against #56's 16m43s for install through sysprep.
- **That is the point worth recording: deleting the cached answer files costs no measurable build time.** #59 adds five `del` targets to `FirstLogonCommands` at `<Order>5</Order>`, and a reasonable worry about putting work between first logon and `sysprep /generalize` is that it lengthens the slowest, least observable stretch of the build. It does not — the delta is inside the noise of two runs. **PR 2's rebuild loop is unaffected**, which matters because CIS hardening is the phase that pays 21 minutes per iteration.
- **What this does NOT establish.** The rebuild proves the image *builds*; it does not prove a clone *specializes*. #59's whole failure mode was a build that looked perfect and a consumer that silently ignored the sysprep CD, and nothing in this playbook can see that — the Order 5 delete is fire-and-forget (`2>nul & exit /b 0`) by design, so it cannot fail the build even if it does nothing. The proof is downstream in `sales.demos`, and #63 stays open until a clone reaches the desktop instead of the OOBE region screen.
- **Cross-repo sessions should start in `sales.demos` (#65).** This repo has no MCP servers at all — no `.mcp.json`, nothing in settings — while `sales.demos/.mcp.json` defines `openshift-sandbox` (read-write, toolsets `core,config,kubevirt`) and `openshift-demo` (read-only). Both are project-scoped and load only when Claude Code starts in that directory; a session started there can still `cd` here and run these playbooks, so it is strictly better than the reverse. Recorded in `CLAUDE.md` and the `windows-image-build` skill.
- **With the caveat that has to travel with it: MCP does not supply the credentials.** The playbooks read `K8S_AUTH_HOST` and `K8S_AUTH_API_KEY` from the environment and assert them non-empty. Recording the pattern without this would read as "start there and the credentials sort themselves out", which is worse than not recording it.
- **`docs/design.md` §4.1 — where the Windows build's three variables actually come from (#61).** §4 listed `K8S_AUTH_HOST`, `K8S_AUTH_API_KEY` and `WINDOWS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and said credentials are env vars, which is the playbook's whole contract — but never said where an operator *gets* them. All three are maintained in `sales.demos` and nowhere else, and rediscovering that costs a search of another repo's vault; it has now been done twice. §4.1 names the three files, and deliberately **does not** reproduce the API URL, which embeds a live RHDP cluster ID.
- **The distinction the note preserves: the playbook's contract is not the same question as where a human fills it in.** `build_windows_image.yml` loads no vault and imports nothing from `sales.demos`, so it stays runnable by someone who has never seen that repo — its header said so, but in a way that read as "these values have nothing to do with sales.demos", which is wrong. Both halves are now stated separately.
- **And the rule that falls out of it: do not materialise them into a file.** `sales.demos` deliberately allows exactly one secrets file and no sourceable second copy. A plaintext `.env` here would be that second copy, in a second repo, expiring never. Export them into the shell that runs the playbook.
- **`playbooks/publish_windows_containerdisk.yml` — PR 3 of #24: the Windows golden image is published.** `VirtualMachineExport` → `disk.img.gz` → sparse expand → `qemu-img convert` → `FROM scratch` + `COPY` to `/disk/disk.img` → `podman build` → `podman push`. **Published and verified from the registry:** `quay.io/zigfreed/win2k22-golden:20260905-1826`, digest `sha256:61c8d5ef…`, private, all labels present. Whole run 27 minutes.
- **`docs/design.md` §10 gains its Windows half** — §10.1 and §10.2 carry the Windows repository, the two Windows-only labels, and `cis.level=none`; **§10.2.1** documents the export path and the four things about it that are not obvious.
- **The publish is deliberately *not* `win2k22-cis-l1-golden`.** What it holds is the unhardened build, and **tags are immutable** — a repository name claiming L1 would make that claim permanently, on media that never had it. PR 2 publishes `win2k22-cis-l1-golden` separately. `com.redhat.cis.level=none` is *stated* rather than omitted, because an absent label reads as an oversight while `none` is a claim, and it is the true one.
- **`image-factory/eval-expires` is stamped on the published image.** The 180-day clock is the thing people forget, and a label on a build VM in a namespace that no longer exists helps nobody.
- `docs/operations.md` — operational runbook for manual rebuild triggers, secret rotation, and troubleshooting. Closes #52
- `README.md` CI/Automation section documenting both GitHub Actions workflows
- **The Windows build no longer needs anyone at the console** (#40). The stock ISO's UEFI boot image asks *"Press any key to boot from CD or DVD"* on a ~5 second timeout and **fails silently** when nobody answers -- the console just sits there, so a build that needs a human is indistinguishable from a build that is merely slow. It cost a wasted 25-minute run. A pod on the cluster now fetches the ISO, verifies `windows_iso_sha256`, swaps Microsoft's own `efisys_noprompt.bin` and `cdboot_noprompt.efi` over their prompting twins, rebuilds with `xorriso` and serves the result over HTTP; the existing `source.http` DataVolume points at that Service instead of at Microsoft. **Only the URL differs** -- DataVolume, VM, `autounattend.xml`, `FirstLogonCommands` and sysprep are untouched and already verified. On the cluster and not the laptop for the reason #36 measured: ~246 MiB/s there against ~1 MiB/s up from here.
- `playbooks/scripts/remaster_iso.sh` -- **the recipe is Red Hat's, verbatim**, from the `modify-windows-iso-file` task in `kubevirt-tekton-tasks` v0.26.0. It does *not* re-point El Torito at the no-prompt image; it deletes `efisys.bin` and `cdboot.efi` and renames the `_noprompt` twins over them, then rebuilds. Both files matter: `efisys.bin` **is** the El Torito boot image and `cdboot.efi` is what lives inside it. Deviating from a shipped, working recipe would buy nothing and risk media that boots on one firmware and not another.
- `.github/workflows/containerdisk-rebuild.yml` — monthly GitHub Actions scheduled rebuild for the RHEL 9 CIS L1 containerDisk. Runs 1st of every month at 06:00 UTC; also supports manual `workflow_dispatch` triggers. Zero playbook changes — secrets provide the RH token and Quay credentials. Closes #48
- `playbooks/build_cis_containerdisk.yml` — builds RHEL 9 CIS L1 qcow2 via Image Builder `guest-image` type, wraps as containerDisk, pushes to private Quay.io repo. Closes #21
- `wait_for_compose.py` handles guest-image compose results (download URL) in addition to AMI compose results — backward-compatible
- `docs/design.md` §10 — containerDisk contract for OpenShift Virtualization: distribution model, OCI labels, credential pattern, compliance evidence strategy. Parallel to §9's AMI contract
- `ROADMAP.md` Phase 1.7 — RHEL 9 CIS L1 containerDisk
- `.claude/skills/rhel9-containerdisk/SKILL.md` — preflight, API validation, run, verify, and troubleshooting for the RHEL 9 containerDisk build
- `.claude/skills/windows-image-build/SKILL.md` — the Windows build had no skill, so its preflight existed only as asserts inside the playbook, discovered one failure at a time. Covers acquiring the media, the run, verification that asks the cluster rather than trusting the recap, and the teardown. Closes #30
- `playbooks/scripts/wim_images.py` — prints the image names inside a `.wim` by parsing the WIM header's XML resource. **`windows_image_name` must match one of those names exactly**; get it wrong and Windows Setup stops on the edition-selection screen, which reads as a hang because there is no console output to explain it.
- `README.md` now lists the four skills. There was no skills section at all, despite three already existing.
- `playbooks/build_windows_image.yml` + `playbooks/templates/autounattend.xml.j2` — unattended Windows Server 2022 build for the Phase 3 containerDisk. **PR 1 of 3 on #24: build only, unhardened.** Hardening is PR 2, export and publish are PR 3.
- **Built on the cluster, not on a laptop.** #21 flags "a local libvirt/KVM scan path — new hypervisor dependency" as its High-risk item; a KubeVirt cluster *is* a hypervisor, so this avoids that dependency rather than incurring it, and the image is exercised by KubeVirt before any consumer sees it. Plain `VirtualMachine` objects driven with `kubernetes.core`, the same way this repo already drives EC2 with `amazon.aws` — **no operator is installed**, so there is no cross-repo dependency on the consumer's cluster configuration.
- **The answer file is delivered as a ConfigMap.** KubeVirt renders a `configMap` volume as an iso9660 CD and Windows Setup reads `autounattend.xml` from removable media, so no ISO-authoring tool is needed on the machine running the playbook.
- **Sysprep is flag-guarded.** `windows_sysprep_at_first_logon` defaults true so PR 1 finishes without a WinRM round trip and stays free of the Windows collections. PR 2 sets it false and syspreps after hardening — generalizing first would throw the hardening away.
- `collections/requirements.yml` pins `kubernetes.core` 6.4.0, matching sales.demos so producer and consumer cannot disagree about the client library.
- `docs/design.md` §4 documents `K8S_AUTH_HOST`, `K8S_AUTH_API_KEY` and `WINDOWS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` — env vars, consistent with the model that section already states. Nothing is read from sales.demos' vault.
- **The playbook refuses to build on the demo cluster.** Builds run on sandbox; demo consumes the published tag and never hosts a build. Asserted rather than merely documented, because a 45-minute Windows install on a cluster someone is presenting from is the mistake worth making impossible.
- **`windows_eval_expires` is required.** Evaluation media expires after 180 days and an expired Windows guest nags and then shuts down hourly. The date is asserted, stamped onto the VM as a label, and printed at the end so it reaches the run-sheet.
- `.claude/skills/collections-sync/SKILL.md` — pin, install, and verify Ansible collections; audit script detects drift between pinned and installed versions. Closes #27
- `.claude/skills/first-time/SKILL.md` — prerequisite validation for new sessions: Hub token in `~/.ansible.cfg`, collections, AWS credential pattern, troubleshooting table
- CLAUDE.md skills table listing all three Claude agent skills
- `.claude/skills/dev-workflow/SKILL.md` — mandatory development cycle for Claude agents working in this repo
- CLAUDE.md workflow section — documents protected `main`, branch naming, multi-session safety, standing merge authorization
- `main` branch protection: required CI checks (`yamllint`, `ansible-lint`), PRs required, enforce admins, no force pushes
- GitHub community health files: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/SECURITY.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`, `.github/pull_request_template.md` — tailored to pipeline context, ROADMAP phases, and the two-consumer contract
- `playbooks/vars/exempt_controls.yml` — curated exempt list with canonical reasons for AWS-inherent CIS rules (`grub2_password`, `ensure_root_password_configured`, `partition_for_tmp`). Merged into `data.json` at generate time; curated entries take precedence over parser-auto-emitted candidates. Closes #11
- `build_cis_image.yml` Image Builder customizations.packages list — installs `aide`, `firewalld`, `systemd-journal-remote` at build time. First experiment toward closing the CIS L1 packaging gaps tracked in #10
- Two more curated exempts (closes #12): `file_permission_user_init_files` (P2; rule targets deployed-system user homes, not the image artifact) and `sshd_limit_user_access` (P3; SSH access policy is a consumer decision)
- `docs/cis-l1-rhel9-status.md` — snapshot of the latest validated compliance state (AMI, score, exempt rules, reproduction steps, validation history). Linked from README's platform table
- Project docs synced to Phase 1 completion state: ROADMAP marks Phase 1 Complete with all new tasks logged; CLAUDE.md current-state paragraph updated; design.md §3 `data.json` example replaced with a real entry instead of placeholder text
- Phase 1.5: pipeline applies the AMI tagging contract (6 tags: `Pipeline`, `OS`, `CIS-Level`, `BuildDate`, `ComposeID`, `Name`) via `amazon.aws.ec2_tag` after compose. Design changed from name-based to tag-based discovery — `docs/design.md` §9.1-9.2 rewritten. DC1's eventual filter becomes a tag filter, not a name filter
- Initial repository structure, MIT License, Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
- README with architecture overview and quick start

- `playbooks/build_cis_image.yml` — Image Builder API integration: token exchange, blueprint creation, compose trigger, polling, AMI capture
- `playbooks/deploy_and_scan.yml` — EC2 deploy, SCAP result extraction, fresh OpenSCAP scan fallback when build-time results are missing
- `playbooks/generate_policy_data.yml` — XCCDF results parser, hardening-score computation, `data.json` generator per `docs/design.md` §3
- `playbooks/filter_plugins/xccdf.py` — namespace-agnostic XCCDF parser; returns rule counts, severity breakdown, hardening score (pass / (pass + fail), excluding N/A and notchecked), and AWS exempt-control candidates (auto-emitted for low-severity failures)
- Sample inventory — Red Hat offline token via `~/.ansible/ansible.cfg`, AWS credentials via env vars
- `collections/requirements.yml` pinning `amazon.aws` to 11.2.0
- `.gitignore` covering credentials, collections, and generated output
- GitHub Actions lint workflow (ansible-lint, yamllint)
- Project-level `CLAUDE.md` capturing repo conventions and the two-consumer contract

### Changed
- **The re-master is now a byte-exact patch rather than a rebuild** (#44), and it is smaller than the design it replaces. Measured on the real medium: `efisys.bin` and `efisys_noprompt.bin` are **the same size** (1,474,560), and the hidden El Torito boot image is a **byte-identical copy** of the first (`3c9eda1a…`). So the whole job is a same-length overwrite of 720 sectors at one LBA — no 4.7 GB extraction, no re-authoring, no discarding UDF, and `iso_remaster_scratch_size` drops from `20Gi` to `8Gi`. Red Hat rebuilds because their pipeline has already extracted to a PVC; there is no such reason here.
- `playbooks/scripts/remaster_iso.sh` locates the EFI boot image by parsing the Boot Record Volume Descriptor at LBA 17 and walking the El Torito catalogue for the `0xEF` platform section — verified against the real medium, which reports catalogue LBA 22 and load RBA 523, matching what libisofs independently printed. **Nothing is written until the bytes at that address are proved byte-identical to `efisys.bin`**, so a misread catalogue fails instead of corrupting the medium. After the patch it re-checks the extent, the ISO's length, and that the medium still mounts and still holds `install.wim`.
- The re-master pod becomes an initContainer on `tekton-tasks-disk-virt` (guestfish, plus `devices.kubevirt.io/kvm`) and a `serve` container on `tekton-tasks` (python3, which the guestfish image lacks). **The KVM request is an extended resource from KubeVirt's device plugin, not a privileged `securityContext`** — the pod still runs under `restricted-v2` as an arbitrary non-root UID. Both images pinned by digest, verified against what this cluster resolves the `v0.26.0` tags to.
- `.claude/skills/windows-image-build/SKILL.md` still described the **pre-#36 media path** in every paragraph that only *implied* a local ISO, after #41 corrected the section that said so outright (#42). "On the specific ISO you downloaded" and a `7z e -so ~/Downloads/...` snippet both assume a copy that no longer exists by default -- the cluster imports the media, pinned by `windows_iso_url` and `windows_iso_sha256`, and the hand-fetch is now shown only where it is still true: after repointing that URL. The `Provisioning` troubleshooting row said "the ISO **upload** is ~4.7 GB" when there is no upload on the default path, and did not mention that the ISO DataVolume now waits on the re-master pod.
- **The `Run` section contradicted itself**, and that is the sharp one: "about forty-five minutes" four lines above the breakdown #41 added, which totals about twenty-two. A skill that quotes two runtimes teaches the reader to trust neither, and the timing is not decoration -- **a build with nobody watching needs a reliable "is this stuck?" threshold**, which is precisely what #40 made the normal case. Now one number, thirty minutes, with what to look at past it.
- `README.md` "Related Projects" renamed to **Related repositories** and rewritten to say what each consumer *receives* and which way the dependency runs, rather than listing them in bare lines. Names the Windows producer/consumer split explicitly: building the image is #24 here, pointing a cluster at it is [sales.demos#3](https://github.com/ericcames/sales.demos/issues/3), and the only thing binding them is one string -- a containerdisk tag. Reciprocal to [sales.demos#204](https://github.com/ericcames/sales.demos/pull/204), so the link works both ways. Closes #38
- The re-master is **on by default** and asserts rather than assumes: `windows_iso_remaster` requires `windows_iso_source=url`, because the pod fetches from `windows_iso_url` and cannot re-master a file that exists only on the operator's laptop. `-e windows_iso_remaster=false` returns the stock ISO and a keypress, and the final recap now says which media the build used.
- **The DataVolume records which media it holds**, as `image-factory/iso-variant: noprompt|stock`, and a `Succeeded` import of the wrong variant is **re-imported**. This is defect 3 from #34 -- *existence is not success* -- in its next disguise: an import made before the re-master existed holds the *prompting* ISO, is `Succeeded`, is the right size, and produces a build that stops dead at the console. Phase alone cannot tell them apart. A DataVolume with no annotation counts as a mismatch and is re-imported once, which costs about two minutes and is the right way round to be wrong.
- The re-master's scratch space is a **PVC, not an `emptyDir`**. Peak use is the extracted tree plus the rebuilt ISO -- about 9.4 GB -- and an `emptyDir` spends the node's ephemeral storage, where crossing the line evicts the pod under disk pressure and reads as an unexplained restart rather than as "out of space". Pod, Service, ConfigMap and PVC are all deleted as soon as the import succeeds.
- The re-master image is pinned **by digest** (`quay.io/kubevirt/tekton-tasks@sha256:87743fb6...`, tag `v0.26.0`), on the same reasoning `execution-environment.yml` pins its base: a factory that cannot say what it consumed cannot say what it produced.
- `.claude/skills/windows-image-build/SKILL.md` -- the media section still told the operator to download 4.7 GB by hand and passed `-e windows_iso_path=`, both left over from before #36 made `url` the default. The cluster fetches the media; the manual download now appears only where it is still true, on the `upload` escape hatch. Adds the no-keypress section, the `iso-variant` check to the verification block (jsonpath form **measured against a live cluster** -- the single-quoted bracket form and the plain dot form both work for this key, the double-quoted bracket form does not), and four troubleshooting rows.
- `ROADMAP.md` Phase 3 -- the keypress row, marked done.
- `windows_iso_sha256` now **defaults to the verified checksum** rather than empty, on the same reasoning `execution-environment.yml` pins terraform: a factory that does not know what it consumed cannot say what it produced. Pass `-e windows_iso_sha256=''` to skip.
- `build_windows_image.yml` records the four WIM images the evaluation ISO actually contains, so the `windows_image_name` default is documented as verified rather than assumed.
- All cross-repo references updated: `aap.as.code` and `demo.datacenter` → [`sales.demos`](https://github.com/ericcames/sales.demos) throughout CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and `docs/design.md` §9
- `docs/design.md` §9 header renamed from "Integration with demo.datacenter (DC1)" to "Downstream consumers" — the mechanism is consumer-agnostic
- Phase 3 roadmap rewritten: Windows Server 2022 will ship as a CIS-hardened containerDisk on Quay.io, not an AWS AMI. Tracked in #21
- CLAUDE.md consumer table expanded to three rows (rego_policy_libraries, sales.demos AMIs, sales.demos containerDisks)
- Branch naming convention aligned with `sales.demos`: `<type>-<issue>-<slug>` replaces `<type>/<description>`
- CONTRIBUTING.md updated: `main` is now protected, PRs always required
- Dynamic VPC and subnet discovery instead of relying on default VPC
- Async oscap execution for long-running scans
- IdentitiesOnly=yes for SSH; unique per-run EC2 instance names
- CI lint workflow restored to green (closes #2): `.yamllint` relaxes `line-length` to 120 (Ansible community norm); `ansible/ansible-lint` action bumped `v24 → v26` for `ansible-core` 2.19 compatibility
- `build_cis_image.yml`: build-output dict moved to a `vars:` block (was a 224-char inline Jinja expression)
- Phase 1 end-to-end run completed 2026-05-11 — first real RHEL 9 CIS L1 AMI through the full pipeline. Score 94.94 vs gate 95; follow-ups tracked in #4, #5, #6, #7

### Fixed
- **The cached answer file delete is now observable and guarded (#69).** #60's `cmd /c del` ran, had permissions (proved by a clone test on the running image), and left the file untouched — but `2>nul & exit /b 0` discarded the error, so the reason could not be determined from the build. Replaced with PowerShell `Remove-Item` that logs before/after state to `C:\Windows\Temp\panther-delete.log`, and added a new `<Order>6</Order>` assert that fails the build if the file survives. Sysprep moves to `<Order>7</Order>`. The assert is the guard #60 should have shipped with — nothing in the build verified the delete worked, which is why a broken fix published, reached a consumer, and was only caught by a human at the OOBE screen.
- **Every clone ignored the consumer's sysprep answer file, because the build left its own cached (#59).** Windows Setup caches the answer file it used into `%WINDIR%\Panther`, and Microsoft's implicit search order puts that cache at **precedence 3** — ahead of removable read/write media at 4 and read-only removable media at 5, which is exactly where KubeVirt's sysprep API presents the consumer's CD. So `sales.demos` built a correct sysprep Secret, attached it, saw the 1 MiB ISO materialise as `sdb` — and every clone still specialized from *this* build's answer file and stopped on the OOBE region screen. The consumer half (`sales.demos#201` / PR #227) was right all along and needed no change. `autounattend.xml.j2` now deletes the cached copies at `<Order>5</Order>`, and sysprep moves to `<Order>6</Order>`.
- **The delete is deliberately *outside* the `windows_sysprep_at_first_logon` guard.** The hardening work sets that flag false and syspreps later over WinRM; that path needs the cache gone just as much, and nothing after first logon re-caches it. Guarding it would mean rediscovering #59 the first time an image is hardened.
- **It also stops shipping `windows_admin_password` in clear text inside the published containerDisk.** Microsoft gives that as the second reason the cleanup is mandatory before delivery. The password is a throwaway by design, so this is a real fix and not an urgent one.
- **The export's token secret is named in `status.tokenSecretRef`, not `spec`.** `virtctl` sets `spec` itself, so a manual check with `virtctl` exercises a path a playbook creating the export directly never takes — **the same shape as #44's synthetic ISO: testing with a different tool than the code uses proves the wrong thing.**
- **A `no_log: true` task that fails tells you nothing.** The token read is correctly `no_log` — its result carries the token — but the failure came back as `censored` and cost a run to diagnose. `no_log` stays; asserts either side of it now fail with real messages.
- **The export offers every volume the VM had**, the install ISO included. The root volume is selected by name — taking the first would publish a Windows *installer* as a golden image, and it would look plausible until a consumer booted it.
- **Running out of disk happens at the END**, after the slow download has already succeeded. `output_dir` defaults inside the repo, and the intermediates are tens of GB where the RHEL containerDisk's are ~2. There is now a free-space assert that fails in a second, and the gzip and raw are deleted as soon as each is consumed — peak ~26 GiB instead of ~40.
- **Teardown of a wedged build took an hour, and a build started behind it silently reused the old VM** (#54). Two defects, one sequence, both hit while rebuilding for #50.

  **The hour:** the build VM inherited `terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 3600` from KubeVirt's Windows preference. Measured — a launcher pod deleted at 16:41 carried `deletionTimestamp` **17:41**. A guest wedged mid-Setup never shuts down cleanly, so the pod waits out the entire grace period with the namespace `Terminating` behind it. An hour is right for a machine someone cares about and wrong for a throwaway that exists to be rebuilt; now 60 seconds via `build_termination_grace_seconds`, which still lets a healthy guest flush and halt.

  **The quiet part:** the build then ran anyway, against the terminating namespace. Kubernetes refuses to *create* objects there — but **every object the build needs already existed from the previous run**, so `state: present` was a no-op patch and nothing errored. The playbook waited for the *previous, looping* VM to power off, having reported it had created a new one. It looked completely normal. There is now an assert that refuses to build into a `Terminating` namespace.

- **The safe way to clear a wedged guest is `virtctl stop <vm> --force --grace-period=0`**, which asks virt-handler to destroy the domain through the KubeVirt API. Used here, it cleared in about five minutes what had fifty left to run. It is **not** the same as `oc delete pod --force`, which wedges virt-handler so it then refuses to start any new domain with nothing surfaced anywhere. The new failure message names the safe path and warns off the other.

- **Teardown staying asynchronous is deliberate** and was not changed. `wait: false` is right — a namespace with PVCs can take many minutes and nothing in the teardown path needs to watch it go. The fix belongs in the *build* refusing to start, not in the teardown blocking.

- **Removing the keypress made the install CD boot unconditionally, so Windows Setup restarted forever** (#50). The first build after #40 ran four hours with the progress bar moving and never finished. It was not slow — progress **went backwards**: 51% at 12:36, 82% at 14:08, **49% at 16:33**. That figure is monotonic within a run, so a decrease means a new run.

  Windows Setup reboots partway through every installation. The firmware re-runs the boot order, and with `installcd bootOrder=1` and no prompt left to time out, it booted the CD again and Setup began from zero. `virt-launcher` showed one continuous domain the whole time, so nothing above the guest could see it.

  **"Press any key to boot from CD or DVD" is what made CD-first survivable.** It is the mechanism that lets a machine with bootable install media boot the *installed* OS on later reboots. Fixed by ordering `rootdisk bootOrder: 1`, `installcd bootOrder: 2` — which is what Red Hat's `windows-efi-installer` ships, and which is self-resolving: the blank disk has no ESP so the firmware falls through to the CD on the first boot, and once Setup has written an ESP the installed OS boots and carries on to sysprep.

- **This is #36 and #40 interacting, and #36 was right at the time.** #36 moved the CD ahead of the disk because with the disk first *"EFI tried the blank root disk, found no ESP, fell through to the CD, and by then the only thing on screen was a prompt nobody could answer."* That is the same fall-through the fix now relies on — measured, on this cluster. **#40 removed the reason for #36's order and should have reverted it in the same PR.** The two settings are one decision and are now commented as one.

- **A build that never reaches Stopped now says what that usually means.** The 60-minute timeout already existed and would have caught this, but with a generic message. It now names the loop, tells you to read the console percentage twice, and points at the boot order.
- **The guestfish image ships no CA bundle, so the re-master could not fetch the ISO at all** (#46). `curl: (77) error setting certificate file`. Probed against the pinned digest: neither `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` nor `/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt` exists in `tekton-tasks-disk-virt`, and its curl is RHEL-built expecting a trust store the image does not carry — **so every HTTPS fetch from it fails, whatever the URL**. Split into three stages: `fetch` on `tekton-tasks`, which had already pulled this exact URL from Microsoft successfully; `remaster` on `tekton-tasks-disk-virt` with the KVM device, which now needs no network at all; and `serve`. Each image does only what it is demonstrably able to do.
- **#45 was verified with `ISO_URL=file://`**, because the ISO was already on the PVC from the failed run — so the fix was proven against the real medium and the *transport* went untested. Same shape as #44 one layer over: **the part that did not have to be re-run is the part that broke.** Rejected `curl -k` as the fix: `windows_iso_sha256` is pinned and checked, so TLS is belt-and-braces here, but turning verification off to work around a missing trust store is the wrong habit to write into a factory.
- The failure rescue now reads **both** initContainer logs. Kubernetes refuses an unqualified log request once a pod has more than one container, and either stage can be the one that failed — asking for only `remaster` would have returned an empty log for every fetch-side failure, including this one.
- **The #40 re-master failed on real media: the Windows ISO is UDF and `xorriso` cannot read it** (#44). The first real run extracted **one node, 135 bytes**, and the extraction guard fired. `guestfish ... list-filesystems` on the medium the importer had already fetched says `/dev/sda: udf`; the ISO 9660 tree is a stub. **It has to be UDF** — `sources/install.wim` is 4,340,202,461 bytes, past ISO 9660's 4 GiB single-extent limit. libisofs, which `xorriso` reads with, has no UDF reader. **This also explains a detail #41 had read past:** Red Hat's `modify-windows-iso-file` extracts with `guestfish` and asks for `devices.kubevirt.io/kvm`, and #41's PR body treated avoiding that device as a win. It is not a win — **the device is what buys UDF support**, because libguestfs boots a kernel that has a UDF driver.
- **The verification in #41 used a synthetic ISO built by the tool under test**, so it proved the mechanism and never the medium. It established that `xorriso` reads Joliet when Rock Ridge is absent — true, and irrelevant, because the real medium's ISO 9660 side carries nothing to read. Same lesson as the seven defects on #24, one level up. **The guard added in #41 is what caught it**, and it caught it in ninety seconds with nothing built.
- **`"{{ x | int }}"` inside a nested definition reaches the module as the STRING `'8080'`, and bare `"{{ x }}"` reaches it as the integer.** The opposite of what the filter name suggests, measured rather than assumed. `containerPort` is `int32` and both the readiness probe's port and the Service's ports are `IntOrString`, **where a string means a *named* port** -- so the wrong one does not error anywhere. The probe simply never passes and the pod never becomes Ready. Caught before the first run; it would have looked like a slow re-master.
- **`spec.running: true` restarted the VM after sysprep, booting the generalized image into OOBE** (#37). `running` is a *desired state*, not one-shot: when the guest powered itself off at the end of `sysprep /generalize /oobe /shutdown`, KubeVirt started it straight back up. **This is the most dangerous defect found so far, because it produces a disk that looks fine and is not** — OOBE consumes the generalization, and a "golden image" that was never generalized surfaces much later as cloned VMs colliding on SIDs and machine names. Caught only because someone had the console open. Replaced with `runStrategy: Once`, which starts the VMI exactly once and leaves the VM `Stopped` when the guest halts — also making "wait for Stopped" a real completion signal rather than a race it could never win.
- **The ISO was transferred the wrong way across the network** (#36). The playbook had the operator's machine download 4.7 GB from Microsoft and push the same 4.7 GB back up a domestic uplink. Measured: **~1 MiB/s up, ~75 min**, against **~246 MiB/s** for CDI importing directly on the cluster — **117 s end to end, verified**. `windows_iso_source` now defaults to `url` and CDI imports via `source.http`; the `upload` path remains for a cluster with no egress. **This was not a bug** — the code did what it said. It was the wrong shape, and only a stopwatch revealed it.
- **The virtio-win image reference was wrong three ways** (#36): the repo is `virtio-win-rhel9` not `virtio-win`, it *refuses* the `:latest` tag so an untagged reference cannot pull at all, and CNV pins it by digest which moves with the CNV version. No hardcoded string stays correct. The playbook now reads the `virtio-win` ConfigMap that HCO publishes in `openshift-cnv`, which is right on any cluster at any version; `virtio_win_image` remains an override for air-gapped mirrors.
- **Boot order put the blank root disk ahead of the install CD** (#36), so EFI tried an empty disk first and fell through to a prompt nobody could answer.
- `cnv_namespace` was referenced as `win_cnv_namespace`, a variable that never existed. **`ansible-lint` passes this at the production profile** — undefined runtime variables are not something static analysis catches, which is worth remembering when a lint-green playbook has never been executed.
- **`virtctl` ignored `K8S_AUTH_*` and silently targeted `localhost:8080`** (#33). Those are the *python* client's variables, consumed by `kubernetes.core`; `virtctl` is a Go client that reads a kubeconfig or its own flags. The play-level `environment:` block covered every `kubernetes.core` task and nothing else — invisible until the playbook actually ran, which #29 said in as many words had not happened. Fixed with a mode `0600` kubeconfig written to a temp file and deleted in an `always:` block; `--token` would have worked and would have put the bearer token in the process list where any local user can read it with `ps`.
- **The ISO upload deadlocked on `WaitForFirstConsumer` storage** — `cannot upload to DataVolume in PendingPopulation phase`. The PVC will not bind until a pod consumes it, and the upload needs it bound first. `--force-bind` is the imperative twin of the `cdi.kubevirt.io/storage.bind.immediate.requested` annotation. Measured on sandbox: the default class is `ocs-external-storagecluster-ceph-rbd`, WFFC.
- **The idempotence check tested existence rather than success, and that was the dangerous one.** A failed upload leaves the DataVolume behind in `PendingPopulation`, so a re-run that only asked "does it exist?" would have skipped the upload and installed Windows from an **empty disk** — a broken image that looks like a successful build. The playbook now reads the DataVolume's phase, deletes a non-`Succeeded` one, and re-uploads.
- `ROADMAP.md` Phase 3 and `CLAUDE.md` tracked the Windows producer as `sales.demos#193`. That issue was **transferred into this repo** and is now [#24](https://github.com/ericcames/image.builder.pipeline/issues/24), so the roadmap asserted "permanent home is this repo" while the tracker pointed elsewhere. GitHub redirects a transferred issue so neither link was broken, but the reference read as "the work lives in the other repo" — the opposite of the decision Phase 3 records — and sent a reader out of this repository to be bounced back into it. `sales.demos` updated its 24 references in its PR #200. Closes #25
- `build_cis_image.yml` token lookup path — was reading from frozen `~/.ansible/ansible.cfg` (stale Oct 2025 token) instead of active `~/.ansible.cfg`. Latent bug that would 401 on next token rotation. Closes #22
- Stale "Same AWS account as DC1" claim in CLAUDE.md — Image Builder builds in service account `463606842039` and shares with the consumer account; CLAUDE.md now matches the corrected design.md §9.1
- `docs/design.md` §9.1 and `ROADMAP.md` AMI ownership contract — Red Hat Image Builder is a **hosted service** that builds AMIs in its own service account (`463606842039`) and shares them with the consumer account via the API's `share_with_accounts` field. The consumer never owns the AMI, only receives launch permission. Previous text claimed "pipeline and DC1 share one AWS account; no cross-account sharing" and prescribed `owners = ["self"]` for the DC1 data source — both wrong. Surfaced when [demo.datacenter PR #14](https://github.com/ericcames/demo.datacenter/pull/14) ran end-to-end and `terraform plan` returned "no results" against the shared AMI.
- AMI region taken from compose result instead of assumed
- `network_interfaces` deprecation in `amazon.aws` module
- Empty `TARGET_PLATFORM` env var handled with default filter
- Duplicate vars block in `deploy_and_scan.yml` merged
- `generate_policy_data.yml` now reads `scap/scap-results.xml` (matches the path `deploy_and_scan.yml` writes)
- `build_cis_image.yml` no longer fails mid-compose when the access token expires — polling moved to `scripts/wait_for_compose.py` which refreshes the token every iteration. Closes #4
- `deploy_and_scan.yml` default instance type bumped `t3.micro → t3.medium`; the smaller size OOMs reliably during the RHEL 9 SCAP scan. Closes #5
- `deploy_and_scan.yml` cleanup now lives in a `block:`/`always:` so AWS resources are torn down even when the scan task fails. Closes #6

### Verified
- **The publish path, on the real artifact** (2026-09-05): `disk.img.gz` 4.6 GB at ~15 MB/s from the export proxy; sparse raw **60 GiB apparent, 8.7 GiB on disk**; qcow2 **8.65 GiB**, reproduced byte-identically from a second independent export. Registry read-back confirms the digest, all seven labels, one layer, and that anonymous access returns 401 — **private**.
- **Measured rather than assumed, and it reversed a design decision.** The laptop uploads at **~4.97 MB/s (~40 Mbps)**, not the ~1 MiB/s of #36 — that figure was a *cluster-side* limit through `cdi-uploadproxy`, not this uplink. So the publish stays laptop-side like `build_cis_containerdisk.yml`, and an in-cluster build was rejected: it would have put registry credentials in the cluster to save about twenty minutes.
- **The Windows build completes unattended, and the numbers are now measured rather than guessed** (2026-09-05, `cluster-kbjvc`, clean namespace to a `Stopped` generalized VM): re-master **2m23s**, CDI import **2m20s**, install + virtio-win tools + guest agent + sysprep + shutdown **16m43s** — **21m26s total**. `guestOSInfo` reported `Windows Server 2022 Standard Evaluation`, which proves in one field that Setup completed, the right edition came out of `install.wim`, the machine rebooted into the OS, and `FirstLogonCommands` ran. The VM ended `Stopped` and stayed there, so `runStrategy: Once` is still holding and the #37 OOBE defect did not recur.
- **Two documented timings were wrong and are replaced:** "about forty-five minutes" (inherited) and "about thirty" (added in #42). Both predated any completed run.
- **"External Ceph is the bottleneck" was wrong and is retracted.** It was computed from three console readings assuming monotonic progress; the progress was not monotonic, it was a boot loop (#50). The storage is fine — the same cluster does the whole build in 21 minutes.
- **Before any of it touched a cluster.** `xorriso -osirrox on -extract` reads **Joliet** names when Rock Ridge is absent, which is the case on Windows media -- so `sources/install.wim` and `cdboot_noprompt.efi` survive the round trip with case and length intact. That was the one thing that could have quietly mangled the ISO; Red Hat sidesteps it with `guestfish`, which wants `devices.kubevirt.io/kvm`, while `xorriso` keeps the pod unprivileged. Confirmed on a synthetic Joliet-only ISO, then end to end inside the pinned image itself: `-report_el_torito` reports the UEFI entry at `/efi/microsoft/boot/efisys.bin` with `Ldsiz 2624` -- 1,343,488 bytes, the no-prompt image, not the 1,376,256-byte original. The missing-bootloader guard was proved by building an ISO without it and watching the script exit 1.
- Windows Server 2022 evaluation ISO, from Microsoft's own fwlink (`LinkID=2195280`, redirecting to `software-static.download.prss.microsoft.com`): **5,044,094,976 bytes**, SHA256 `3e4fa6d8507b554856fc9ca6079cc402df11a8b79344871669f0251535255325`, volume `SSS_X64FREE_EN-US_DV9`.
- `sources/install.wim` holds 4 images. `Windows Server 2022 SERVERSTANDARD` is index 2, the Desktop Experience variant — which is what the playbook already defaulted to, now confirmed instead of guessed. Every `EDITIONID` is `ServerStandardEval` / `ServerDatacenterEval`, which is how evaluation media is told apart from licensed media at a glance.
- The full preflight chain runs green against the real ISO — state, connection, demo-cluster refusal, inputs, checksum match, `virtctl` — failing only at the first cluster API call, which is as far as it can get without a live cluster.

### Lesson
- **`CLAUDE.md` gains a Verification section.** Six defects landed on #24 in one day (#42, #44, #46, #50, #54, and the export token), `ansible-lint` passed at the production profile through every one of them, and the same few mistakes produced most of them: testing against a fixture built by the tool under test; testing with a different tool than the code uses; not re-running the part that was already known to work; reading a moving indicator once; and removing a manual step without asking what it did on the paths nobody was looking at. Those are rules about how to work in this repo rather than facts about one playbook, so they now live where the next session will read them before starting.
- **The keypress was described as the last *manual* step — noise to be removed. It was also load-bearing.** Nothing recorded what the prompt did on the *second* boot, so removing it changed behaviour nobody had written down, and the replacement looked healthy for four hours. **Before removing a manual step, ask what it does on the paths you are not looking at.** Three of this session's four defects (#44, #46, #50) were found by executing, none by lint; #50 needed the same measurement taken *twice* to be visible at all, because a single reading of a moving progress bar is indistinguishable from progress.
- **A rate computed from an assumption is not a measurement.** "~3 minutes per percentage point, so external Ceph is the bottleneck" was derived from three samples assuming monotonic progress. With restarts the inference was void, and it had already been repeated to the user as a reason demos might be slow. The true install speed remains unmeasured.
