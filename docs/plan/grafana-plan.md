# Grafana Cloud observability

Issue [#260](https://github.com/ericcames/sales.demos/issues/260), sibling of
[#99](https://github.com/ericcames/sales.demos/issues/99) (Dynatrace).

## Context

No observability infrastructure existed in this repo before this work. #99
tracks agentic observability via Dynatrace — application-level, OneAgent-based,
requiring an NFR SaaS tenant. This is the infrastructure-level complement:
cluster metrics, logs, AAP job telemetry — using Grafana Cloud's free tier.

**Why Grafana Cloud, not self-hosted:**

- Survives RHDP environment rebuilds. Both RHDP environments expired silently
  once (#101); anything deployed on the cluster died with them. An external SaaS
  instance does not.
- Free tier: 10k metrics series, 50 GB logs, 50 GB traces, 3 users, no credit
  card. Sufficient for two demo environments.
- No infrastructure to deploy, no operator to manage, no database to provision.
  Compare with Automation Orchestrator (#108/#141), which took CloudNativePG and
  three databases to get running.

**Why an MCP server:**

The same thesis as #102: stop paying a manual lookup every time the question is
"is the cluster healthy" or "how long did the last provision take." The official
`grafana/mcp-grafana` (3.4k stars, Apache-2.0, Grafana Labs) covers dashboards,
Prometheus queries, Loki log queries, alerting, incidents, annotations and more.
It runs as stdio, so it fits the same model as `kubernetes-mcp-server`.

## The MCP server

### `--scope local`, not `.mcp.json`

Follows the AAP MCP server pattern from
[`platform-addons-plan.md`](platform-addons-plan.md). Three reasons:

1. **The service account token is a standalone credential.** OpenShift
   kubeconfigs are derived artifacts — `make-kubeconfig.sh` generates them from
   vault contents, so `.mcp.json` references a gitignored path and the credential
   has an obvious refresh. A Grafana Cloud SA token is created in the UI with no
   vault-backed derivation step. It is the credential, not a cache of one.
2. **The URL is sensitive.** It contains the Grafana Cloud org slug. By the
   Dynatrace precedent (#99 S3), vendor-specific SaaS URLs are treated as
   credentials — the RHDP exception does not extend to other vendors.
3. **There is one instance.** OpenShift and AAP are per-environment (the
   environment is in the server's name, #16). Grafana Cloud is a single external
   service that spans both. One server named `grafana`, not two.

### Credentials

Both go in the vault (`playbooks/group_vars/all/secrets.yml`) as **top-level
keys**, not under `env_secrets`:

```yaml
grafana_cloud_url: "https://<org>.grafana.net"
grafana_cloud_sa_token: "glsa_..."
```

Top-level because they span both environments — the same reasoning that puts
`rhsm_org_id` and `vaulted_subscriptions_client_id` at the top level.

The service account is created with the **Viewer** role. Read-only, matching
the governance thesis: MCP reads, Ansible writes. Even with no Ansible write
path for Grafana yet, constraining the token from the start means the demo can
safely show that the agent reads but does not modify dashboards or alerts.

### Registration

`utilities/make-grafana-mcp.sh` reads from the vault and runs:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope local \
  -e GRAFANA_URL="$GRAFANA_URL" \
  -e GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN="$GRAFANA_TOKEN" \
  grafana -- uvx mcp-grafana
```

Key differences from `make-aap-mcp.sh`:

- Takes no arguments (one instance, not per-environment)
- No kubeconfig dependency
- No token creation step (token is pre-created in the Grafana UI)
- `--transport stdio` (not `--transport http`)

### The token exception

Same exception as the AAP MCP token documented in
[`platform-addons-plan.md`](platform-addons-plan.md): an MCP client needs a
durable credential, so `CLAUDE.md`'s `always:` cleanup rule does not apply.
The token is created in the Grafana Cloud UI and revoked there.

### Allowlist

`.claude/settings.json` carries `mcp__grafana__*`, pointing at a server that
does not exist until `make-grafana-mcp.sh` runs. This is the same expected
state as the AAP servers — documented in the `sales-demos-mcp` skill.

## Grafana Cloud account setup

Manual, in a browser. Cannot be scripted.

1. Sign up at grafana.com (free tier, no credit card)
2. Note the instance URL (e.g., `https://<org>.grafana.net`)
3. Administration > Service Accounts > Add Service Account
4. Assign the **Viewer** role
5. Generate a service account token
6. Add both values to the vault:
   ```bash
   ansible-vault edit playbooks/group_vars/all/secrets.yml \
     --vault-id sales.demos@~/secrets/.vault_pass_sales_demos
   ```

## Verification

1. `bash utilities/make-grafana-mcp.sh` completes without error
2. `claude mcp list` shows `grafana` alongside the existing servers
3. Restart Claude Code, then call a Grafana MCP tool (e.g.,
   `list_datasources` or `search_dashboards`) — it should connect and return
   data from the free-tier instance (even if empty on a fresh account)

## Phase 1 — Feed data in (#265)

Deploy Grafana Alloy on the OpenShift clusters to push metrics (Prometheus
remote-write) and logs (Loki) to Grafana Cloud. Separate playbook
(`deploy_alloy.yml`) plus a skill — opt-in, not baked into `setup.yml`.
Sandbox first, demo once proven.

**Demo headline:** "We instrument the entire platform with Ansible — OCP cluster
health, KubeVirt VM metrics, AAP job telemetry — and the AI agent queries it all
through Grafana Cloud."

### Prometheus federation, not direct scraping

OCP already scrapes kubelet, cAdvisor, kube-state-metrics, node-exporter, and
KubeVirt metrics via built-in ServiceMonitors. Duplicating all of that scrape
configuration in Alloy is fragile and pointless. Instead, Alloy federates from
the Prometheus endpoint (`prometheus-k8s.openshift-monitoring.svc:9091/federate`)
using the SA bearer token and the existing `cluster-monitoring-view` ClusterRole.
Thanos Query does not implement `/federate`, so the federation target is the
underlying Prometheus instance, not the Thanos Querier (verified #273).

The `match[]` parameters on the federation endpoint are the series budget
control — we select only what we need:

- `kubevirt_vmi_*` — VM metrics (the demo headline)
- `node_cpu_seconds_total`, `node_memory_*`, `node_filesystem_*`,
  `node_network_*` — node health
- `kube_pod_status_phase`, `kube_pod_container_resource_requests`,
  `kube_node_status_*` — namespace-filtered to `aap`, `sales-demos-*`,
  `openshift-cnv`
- `container_cpu_usage_seconds_total`, `container_memory_working_set_bytes` —
  namespace-filtered

A relabel rule drops noisy CPU modes (irq, softirq, steal, nice, guest) and
pause containers from cAdvisor. Measured total: **~2,098 series** (2026-09-06)
out of the 10k budget — substantial headroom for Phase 2 additions.

### AAP metrics — separate scrape job

AAP's metrics endpoint uses different auth (basic auth, not SA bearer) and
lives on a different service. Alloy scrapes the gateway at `aap.aap.svc:80`
with path `/api/controller/v2/metrics/` using the existing `aap_username` /
`aap_password` from the vault — no new token to manage. On AAP 2.7 the
controller service (`aap-controller-service`) returns 401 on direct basic-auth
requests; authentication routes through the gateway, and the controller path
prefix is required (verified #273).

### API-based log collection, not hostPath

`loki.source.kubernetes` streams logs via the Kubernetes API, avoiding hostPath
volumes and the `hostmount-anyuid` SCC. The DaemonSet runs under the default
`restricted` SCC. The tradeoff — slightly higher API server load, possible
missed lines during pod restarts — is irrelevant for a demo environment.

Scoped to four namespaces: `aap`, `sales-demos-{{ aap_env_name }}`,
`openshift-cnv`, `grafana-alloy`. System namespaces (`openshift-*`) are excluded
to avoid consuming the 50 GB log budget on control-plane noise.

### Push credentials — five new vault keys

The existing Viewer SA token (`grafana_cloud_sa_token`) is for MCP reads. Alloy
needs *write* credentials — a Cloud Access Policy token with `metrics:write` and
`logs:push` scopes, plus the Prometheus and Loki push endpoints and usernames.

Five new **top-level** keys in `playbooks/group_vars/all/secrets.yml` (top-level
because Grafana Cloud spans both environments):

```yaml
grafana_cloud_prom_push_url: "https://prometheus-prod-XX.grafana.net/api/prom/push"
grafana_cloud_prom_username: "<instance-id>"
grafana_cloud_loki_push_url: "https://logs-prod-XX.grafana.net/loki/api/v1/push"
grafana_cloud_loki_username: "<instance-id>"
grafana_cloud_push_api_key: "glc_..."
```

Created manually in the Grafana Cloud portal: Security → Access Policies →
Create → scopes `metrics:write`, `logs:push` → generate token.

### DaemonSet sizing

100m/256Mi request, 500m/512Mi limit. On the RHDP single-node cluster (32 vCPU,
128 GiB, ~9% CPU / 36% memory used), this is negligible.

### Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Prometheus federation 403 with `cluster-monitoring-view` | Playbook creates the CRB; verified working (#273). Thanos Query does not implement `/federate` — target is `prometheus-k8s` |
| AAP controller service 401 on direct basic-auth | Use the gateway at `aap.aap.svc:80` with path `/api/controller/v2/metrics/`; verified working (#273) |
| RHDP environment expires — Alloy dies | Grafana Cloud retains data; re-run playbook |
| Docker Hub rate limit on `grafana/alloy` image pull | Mirror to quay.io or PAH container registry |
| Cluster-scoped RBAC resources survive namespace deletion | `alloy_state=absent` teardown path cleans up everything |

### Verification via Grafana MCP

Once data flows, the existing MCP server (Phase 0) can query it:

1. `list_prometheus_metric_names` with `regex: "node_cpu_seconds_total"` —
   confirms metrics arriving
2. `query_prometheus` with `expr: "up"` — confirms scrape targets healthy
3. `list_loki_label_names` — confirms logs arriving with expected labels
4. `query_prometheus` with `expr: "count({__name__!=\"\"})"` — confirms under
   10k series

### Files

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `playbooks/deploy_alloy.yml` | Create — the playbook |
| `.claude/skills/sales-demos-alloy/SKILL.md` | Create — the skill |
| `playbooks/group_vars/all/secrets.yml.example` | Modify — add 5 push credential keys |
| `utilities/check-secrets-example.py` | Modify — add STAGED entries if needed |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Modify |

No new collection dependencies — `kubernetes.core` covers everything.

## Phase 2 + 3 — Dashboard as code (#275)

Phases 2 and 3 are combined: dashboards are defined as committed JSON and
pushed to Grafana Cloud by a playbook, so the demo story and the config-as-code
thesis ship together.

### What shipped

A single "Cluster Health" dashboard (`playbooks/files/grafana/cluster-health.json`)
that serves as both a pre-demo readiness check and a customer-facing demo artifact.
Five sections:

1. **Overview** — stat panels for nodes ready, VMs running, pods healthy, AAP
   status, Alloy status, series budget.
2. **Cluster Nodes** — CPU utilization, memory usage, filesystem usage, network
   throughput.
3. **KubeVirt VMs** — VM status table, per-VM CPU/memory/network.
4. **AAP Platform** — capacity gauge, running/pending jobs, managed hosts, job
   templates, DB connections, license expiry, pod CPU/memory.
5. **Logs** — Loki log panel with namespace filtering.

A `cluster` template variable makes one dashboard definition work for both
sandbox and demo environments. A `namespace` multi-select variable filters logs.

### Credential strategy

A second Grafana Cloud service account with **Editor** role
(`grafana_cloud_editor_sa_token`). The existing Viewer SA stays for MCP reads —
the governance thesis (MCP reads, Ansible writes) is a demo talking point, so
the tokens stay separate.

### Files

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `playbooks/files/grafana/cluster-health.json` | Create — the dashboard JSON |
| `playbooks/deploy_dashboard.yml` | Create — the playbook |
| `.claude/skills/sales-demos-dashboard/SKILL.md` | Create — the skill |
| `playbooks/group_vars/all/secrets.yml.example` | Modify — add Editor SA token key |
| `utilities/check-secrets-example.py` | Modify — remove `grafana_cloud_url` from STAGED |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Modify |

No new collection dependencies — `ansible.builtin.uri` is core Ansible.

### What's next

- More dashboards (VM provisioning timing, AAP job duration histograms)
- Alerting rules (Phase 4, not yet planned)
- Dynatrace pairing (#99) for application-level observability
