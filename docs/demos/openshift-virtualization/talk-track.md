# Talk track — OpenShift Virtualization

**Rehearse from this. Present from [`run-sheet.md`](run-sheet.md).**

This is the narrative layer: what to say, why each beat is in the deck, and how
to get from one to the next. Text in blockquotes is meant to be said more or
less as written — not because the words are precious, but because these are the
sentences that took several deliveries to get right.

Everything a live run would put on screen is embedded below, so the whole track
works with no cluster.

---

## Who is in the room

**You are the pre-sales engineer.** Every document in this folder is written to
you.

**They are a sysadmin** — Linux or platform, ten years in, currently running
VMware or a mixed estate, and they have automated things before. Probably with
shell scripts, possibly with Ansible already, and they have been burned by an
automation someone else wrote and left.

What that means for how you present:

| They do not care about | They care intensely about |
|---|---|
| How fast the VM builds | Whether it builds the *same* way next Tuesday |
| The product architecture diagram | Who holds the credentials |
| "Single pane of glass" | What happens the first time it fails at 2 a.m. |
| That it is automated | That it is **legible** — can they read it, change it, and predict it |

**The single most persuasive thing you can do is admit what does not work.** A
sysadmin has sat through demos where the hard parts were skipped. Volunteering
the single-node limitation and the unfinished Windows image buys you more
credibility than any feature. Beat 7 exists for exactly this reason — do not cut
it for time.

**Do not oversell the speed.** "Nine minutes" is a fact and it is fine. "Minutes
instead of weeks" sounds like a slide and invites them to start arguing with the
number instead of listening.

---

## Beat 1 · Cold open on the destination (0–3)

Open on the finished page. Say nothing about how it got there.

![The demo page, served by a real guest](../../images/demo-page-live.png)

> *A genuine capture — this page was served by a running VM over the Route.
> There is also a [rendered copy](../../images/demo-page.png), produced from the
> same template by `utilities/render-demo-assets.py`, which is what keeps this
> talk track working when no cluster is available. Use the live one when you
> have it.*

Point at three things:

> **"That's a RHEL 9 guest. Somebody asked for 'large' — that's the size tier
> line, and it resolved to a cluster instance type called `sd1.large`, two CPUs
> and six gigs. And it deletes itself at 6 o'clock."**
>
> **"This machine did not exist nine minutes before that page was taken. Nobody
> opened a hypervisor console. Nobody allocated an IP. Nobody logged into it —
> not once, not even to install the web server. Let me show you what did
> happen."**

**Why open here.** Two reasons. It sets the destination so every step afterwards
has somewhere to land, and it puts a *concrete artifact* on screen before you
have made a single claim. A sysadmin's default posture is "show me" — get there
inside the first sixty seconds.

**Transition:** *"But the demo isn't the machine. Let me start where you start."*

---

## Beat 2 · The problem, in their words (3–6)

Screen off. Ask:

> **"Walk me through what happens today when a developer asks you for a VM."**

Then stop talking. Genuinely stop — count to five if you have to. Whatever they
describe is your outline for the next twenty minutes, and every later beat lands
harder if you can attach it to something they said.

Listen for:

- **The hand-offs.** Networking allocates the IP, storage carves the LUN,
  security signs off. Each one is a queue.
- **Who patches it, and when.** Usually "eventually", usually a different team.
- **Who deletes it.** Nobody volunteers this. Ask directly if they do not raise
  it: *"and what happens to it when the project's over?"* The pause you get is
  the pause you will come back to at Beat 6.

Reflect it back in their words, then:

> **"Every one of those steps is a judgment call somebody makes. That's why no
> two of your machines are quite the same — not because anyone was careless, but
> because the judgment happened fresh each time. What I'm going to show you
> isn't 'we made VMs faster'. It's that the judgment calls got written down
> once, and now they run the same way every time."**

**Why this beat exists.** If you go straight from the screenshot to the
automation, you are demoing a feature. If you go through their process first,
you are demoing an answer. It is the same content either way — the ordering is
what makes it land.

**Transition:** *"So here's the whole thing a requester sees."*

---

## Beat 3 · The interface is two questions (6–8)

![The launch survey — the entire interface a requester sees](../../images/aap-survey.png)

| Question | Variable | Choices | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| Operating system | `os_type` | `linux` · `windows` · `both` | `linux` |
| VM size tier | `vm_size_tier` | `small` · `medium` · `large` | `small` |

> **"That's it. An OS and a t-shirt size. No IP address, no storage class, no
> hostname — because none of those are decisions the person asking for the
> machine should be making."**

Then the missing dropdown. **This is the beat that earns their attention:**

> **"Notice what isn't there. There's no dropdown for which environment to build
> in. That's deliberate. A dropdown for the target environment is exactly one
> mis-click away from provisioning into the cluster you show customers. So it
> isn't a dropdown — each controller's template is pointed at itself, and the
> playbook fails closed if the two ever disagree."**

**Why this beat exists.** Any vendor can show you a form. Showing them a
*decision about what to leave off* the form tells them the thing was built by
someone who has been on call. Watch their face here — this is usually where a
skeptical sysadmin starts actually listening.

**Transition:** *"Two questions on the front. Here's what's behind them."*

---

## Beat 4 · Behind the button (8–16)

**Start from empty.** Show the namespace with nothing in it — this is the "before"
that makes everything after it mean something:

![The demo namespace before the run — no VirtualMachines found](../../images/ocp-vms-before.png)

> **"That's the project the VM is going to land in. Nothing in it. Watch."**

Then the workflow, mid-run:

![The workflow running — provision in progress, 43 seconds elapsed](../../images/aap-workflow-running.png)

Four nodes, chained left to right, each one gated on the previous succeeding.
Name them, then slow down for three specific points. **Resist the urge to
narrate every task** — you are teaching three ideas, not reading a playbook.

### 4a · The Route returns 503, and that is correct

**Open the URL now, in front of them.** This is what you get:

![The Route before the web server exists — Application is not available](../../images/route-503.png)

> **"The moment Terraform finishes, that URL exists — the hostname resolves,
> the route is live, TLS terminates. And there's nothing behind it, because
> nobody's installed a web server yet."**
>
> **"That's not a bug I'm apologizing for, it's the design. Building the box and
> configuring the box are two different jobs with two different failure modes,
> and keeping them visibly separate means that when something breaks you already
> know which half broke."**

**Say the URL out loud while it is on screen** — it encodes the whole story:
`sd-lnx-medium-1cpu-4gb` is the VM, named for the tier that was requested;
`-web` is the Service backing the route; `sales-demos-sandbox` is the namespace.

```console
$ curl -sI "$(terraform output -raw web_url)" | head -1
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable     # after provision
HTTP/1.1 200 OK                      # after configure
```

Then come back to it after the configure node and reload. **The 503 → 200
transition, live, is the single best proof in the demo** — nothing else you
show makes the separation of concerns as concrete.

**Why:** it reframes an apparent flaw as an architectural choice — and it is
genuinely true, which is why it survives follow-up questions.

### 4b · The ordering you would not guess

> **"Register runs before configure. Not for tidiness. The RHEL 9 boot image
> that OpenShift Virtualization ships with has no package repositories on it at
> all — none. So every `dnf` task fails on an unregistered guest, with an error
> that doesn't obviously say 'you forgot to register'."**
>
> **"That's a debugging session the first time. It's also the entire reason this
> is one workflow instead of three buttons that somebody launches in the wrong
> order at nine in the morning with a customer watching."**

**Why:** this is the most quietly convincing thing in the demo. It says the
automation encodes *experience*, not just steps — and every sysadmin in the room
has their own version of this story.

### 4c · Three different definitions of "done"

| "Done" means | Elapsed |
|---|---|
| `terraform apply` returns | ~10 seconds |
| **The provision job goes green** | **36 seconds** |
| The VM reports `Running` | ~45 seconds |
| sshd actually accepts a connection | about a minute after that |

> **"Four different answers to 'is it ready yet'. And look at the second one —
> the provision job reports Success at thirty-six seconds, while the machine
> is still booting. A green checkmark is not the same as a usable server."**
>
> **"A person learns that by getting Connection refused twice and assuming they
> broke something. The workflow just waits — and the wait is written into the
> playbook rather than into the workflow, so it protects you when you run it by
> hand too."**

**This is the beat where the job-timings screenshot pays off twice**: the
provision node's 36 seconds is visible right there, and so is the fact that
register took four and a half minutes partly *because* it spent the first stretch
waiting for a machine the previous job had already called done.

**Why:** it is a detail nobody fakes. It signals the thing has actually been run
enough times to find the sharp edges.

### And the same namespace, after

![The demo namespace after the run — one VM, Running](../../images/ocp-vms-after.png)

> *A `large-2cpu-6gb` run, so the name and the 6 GiB differ from the survey shot
> above — they are two different launches, not one continuous sequence.*

> **"Same view, one VM, running. Requested 2 CPU, using 6 gigs — which is
> exactly the tier that was asked for. Nobody touched the console to make that
> happen."**

**Watch for `LiveMigratable=True` in that Conditions column.** A sharp sysadmin
will spot it and ask why you said there was no live migration. The answer is
precise and worth having ready:

> **"Good catch — that condition means the VM is *eligible* to migrate: its
> storage is shared, it has no local-only devices. It's a property of how the
> machine was built. What it doesn't have is anywhere to go, because this
> cluster is one node. Give it a second node and that condition becomes
> useful."**

### Close the beat with the real numbers

You have them, from an actual run, so use them rather than rounding:

![The controller's job list for a complete run](../../images/aap-job-timings.png)

| Node | Duration |
|---|---|
| Provision VM | 36 s |
| Register VMs | 4 m 25 s |
| Configure VMs | 3 m 49 s |
| Check VMs | 5 s |
| **Whole workflow** | **9 m 9 s** |

> **"Nine minutes and nine seconds, and look where it goes. Building the machine
> is thirty-six seconds. Ninety percent of the run is registering to the CDN and
> then pulling packages and patches over it — which is exactly the part you'd be
> waiting on anyway if you did this by hand."**

**This table is worth putting on screen.** A sysadmin trusts a job list with
durations in it far more than a presenter saying "about nine minutes", and it
pre-empts the suspicion that the fast part is the only part you showed.

**Transition:** *"So nine minutes later, here's what you've actually got."*

---

## Beat 5 · What you get (16–22)

Back to the screenshot. The point to land is that **nothing on that page is
hardcoded** — every value came from the machine describing itself.

> **"Operating system, kernel, CPU, memory — all gathered from the guest. The
> size tier line shows what they asked for and what it resolved to. And the
> in-cluster address is how AAP reached the machine: plain ssh on port 22, no
> bastion, no jump host, no agent installed. The platform gave it a stable DNS
> name and that was enough."**

### `facts.json`

For the person who asks where the page gets its data — and someone always does:

<!-- rendered: facts.json -->
```json
{
    "hostname": "linuxweb",
    "gathered": "2026-08-11T14:32:07Z",

        "cis_level": "L1",

    }
}
```

> **"Same data, curl-able, at `/facts.json`. And the same facts are cached in
> AAP's database, so they're on the host page in the controller too. One
> gather, two places to read it."**

### The two banners, and why there are two

This is a better beat than it looks. Show them in order.

**Before you authenticate** — `/etc/issue.net`, served over ssh by a drop-in
config that is validated with `sshd -t` and applied with a reload, never a
restart:

> **"'This host is managed by AAP. Manual changes may be reverted.' That one
> line is the whole operating model, printed exactly where somebody who's about
> to do something manual will read it. Not in a wiki. On the box."**

**Why this beat exists.** The banners are the only part of the demo that speaks
to the *human* who inherits the machine. Sysadmins notice that. It also quietly
demonstrates that the automation touched sshd carefully — validated, reloaded,
not restarted — which is the kind of detail that decides whether they trust it
near production.

### Cockpit

> **"Cockpit's installed and the firewall's open for it on every guest. Because
> when somebody asks 'what if I just need to look at the box', the answer should
> be yes."**

**Transition:** *"Now — none of that is the interesting part."*

---

## Beat 6 · Why a sysadmin should care (22–26)

Four points. Do not tour the repository; land these.

**1. It converges, it doesn't just run.**

> **"Run the platform install again and it reports zero changes. That matters
> more than it sounds — it means this is a converger, not a script that assumes
> it's going first. You can run it against a half-built environment and it'll
> finish the job instead of falling over."**

**2. The guardrails are in code, not in a wiki.**

> **"Ask for more memory than the node has, and the Terraform plan fails. It
> does not build you a VM that sits in Pending forever while the automation
> reports success. The budget is a precondition in the module — the failure
> happens at plan time, in the place where you can still do something about
> it."**

This is the one to lean on if they have been burned before. Everyone has a story
about automation that reported success and did nothing.

**3. One implementation, two front doors.**

> **"Everything I've shown you runs from a job template in the platform, and the
> exact same playbook runs from a laptop. Not a reimplementation — the same
> file. The survey variable names, the command-line variables, and the Terraform
> variables are literally the same strings. That's the contract: if you can run
> it one way, you can run it the other, and they cannot drift."**

Why they care: it is the difference between automation they can debug and
automation they have to file a ticket about.

**4. It cleans up after itself.**

Come back to the pause from Beat 2 — *who deletes it?*

> **"You mentioned nobody really owns deleting these. Teardown here is a
> scheduled job — six o'clock, every night. And it's deliberately selective:
> it destroys the VMs but preserves the expensive things, the virtualization
> layer and the boot images and the state, because rebuilding those is
> forty-five minutes you don't want to spend. Cost control is a schedule, not a
> monthly reminder to go look at what's still running."**

**Transition:** *"Before questions, let me tell you what this doesn't do."*

---

## Beat 7 · The honest bits (26–28)

**Do not cut this beat.** It is the highest-value ninety seconds in the session.

> **"Three things I'd rather you hear from me."**
>
> **"One — there's no live migration in what I showed you. That lab cluster is a
> single node. OpenShift Virtualization does live migration; this environment
> physically can't demonstrate it. I'd rather say that than put up a slide about
> it."**
>
> **"Two — Windows is wired up and doesn't boot yet. Terraform builds the VM,
> the inventory group's there, WinRM's configured, and the cluster now points at
> a Windows boot source the same way it points at RHEL's. What's missing is the
> image — Red Hat can't redistribute Windows media, so somebody has to build the
> golden image once, and I haven't. It's tracked in public as issues #3 and
> ericcames/image.builder.pipeline#24, and you can go read them."**
>
> **"Three — one of the config jobs always reports 'changed' even when nothing
> changed, because the platform returns one setting as encrypted on every read
> so Ansible can never see it as settled. Cosmetic, known, written down."**

**Why this works.** You are not confessing weaknesses; you are demonstrating
that the *documentation is honest*, which is the actual claim you want them to
believe. If the known issues are written down in public, the working parts are
probably real too.

**Transition:** *"Which brings me to the last thing."*

---

## Beat 8 · Close (28–30)

Point at the footer of the demo page.

> **"That link is on the page the demo just built. All of it — the Terraform,
> the playbooks, the workflow definition, the survey, and the design notes for
> why it's built this way instead of some other way — is in that repository, in
> public, right now. Nothing I showed you is behind a login, and the known
> problems are in the issue tracker next to the working parts."**

Then **one** question. Ask it and stop:

- *"What's the first thing in your estate you'd point this at?"*
- *"Who else needs to be in the room the second time we do this?"*
- *"Would it be more useful to see this run live against your requirements?"*

| 10 s / 45 s / +1 min | `README.md`, `playbooks/register_vm.yml` |
| 36 s / 4 m 25 s / 3 m 49 s / 5 s, 9 m 9 s total | `docs/images/aap-job-timings.png` — one measured run |
| Memory budget fails at plan time | `terraform/ocpvirt/locals.tf` |
| Nightly teardown, preserving CNV and boot sources | `inventory/group_vars/<env>/controller_schedules.yml`, `playbooks/teardown.yml` |
