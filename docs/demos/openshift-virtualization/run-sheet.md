# Run sheet — OpenShift Virtualization

**This is the page you hold while presenting.** Thirty minutes, no cluster
required. The narrative behind each beat, with the actual words, is in
[`talk-track.md`](talk-track.md) — rehearse from that, present from this.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Length** | 30 minutes (25 + 5 for questions) |
| **Audience** | Linux/platform sysadmins who want to run their estate with AAP |
| **Needs an environment?** | **No.** Every artifact below is in this repo |
| **Assets** | Eight images in [`docs/images/`](../../images/), the two banners and `facts.json` in [`talk-track.md`](talk-track.md), the Mermaid graph in [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) |

2. Have this run sheet on a second screen if you have one.
3. Decide your close before you begin — see **Landing it** at the bottom.

If you *do* have a live environment, read **[Running it live](#running-it-live)**
first; it changes three beats and nothing else.

## The arc

| Time | Beat | On screen |
|---|---|---|
| 0–3 | Cold open — the destination | `demo-page-live.png` |
| 3–6 | The problem, in their words | nothing |
| 6–8 | The whole interface is two questions | `aap-survey.png` |
| 8–16 | What happens behind the button | `ocp-vms-before.png` → `aap-workflow-running.png` → `route-503.png` → `ocp-vms-after.png` → `aap-job-timings.png` |
| 16–22 | What you get | `demo-page-live.png`, MOTD, `facts.json` |
| 22–26 | Why a sysadmin should care | the repo |
| 26–28 | The honest bits | nothing |
| 28–30 | Close | the page footer |

---

## 0–3 · Cold open on the destination

**Show `demo-page-live.png` before you say anything about how it got there.**
(`demo-page.png` is the rendered equivalent — same page, use either.)

Point at three things and nothing else:

- the hostname and the green dot — *"that's a RHEL 9 guest"*
- **Size tier** `large-2cpu-6gb → sd1.large` — *"somebody asked for 'large'"*
- the amber notice — *"and it deletes itself at 6 PM"*

> **"This machine did not exist nine minutes before that screenshot was taken.
> Nobody opened a hypervisor console, nobody allocated an IP, and nobody
> logged into it. Let me show you what did happen."**

Then **rewind**.

---

## 3–6 · The problem

No screen. Ask, then shut up and let them answer:

> **"Walk me through what happens today when a developer asks you for a VM."**

Their answer is your outline for the rest of the session. Listen for: the
ticket, the hand-off between teams, who owns the IP, when it gets patched,
and — the one nobody volunteers — **who deletes it afterwards**.

Reflect it back, then:

> **"Every one of those steps is somebody's judgment call, which is why no two
> of your machines are quite the same. The demo isn't 'we made VMs faster'. It's
> that the judgment calls got written down once."**

---

## 6–8 · The entire interface is four questions

**Show `aap-survey.png`.** This is the whole thing a requester sees:

| Question | Variable | Choices | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hypervisor | `hypervisor` | `ocpvirt` | `ocpvirt` |
| VM size tier | `vm_size_tier` | `small` · `medium` · `large` | `large` |
| Workload role | `vm_role` | `web` · `db` · `app` | `web` |
| How many VMs | `vm_count` | `1` · `2` | `1` |

Source: the `Linux Day 1 - 0 Workflow` survey in
`inventory/group_vars/aap/controller_workflows.yml`.

**This table has been wrong three times, and each correction is worth a
sentence of the talk track.** It said one question and a `small` default; the
default became `large` in 2026-09-08 (the demo is about speed, so it should not
open on the tier that makes every step slower), `vm_role` and `vm_count` arrived
with farms in #389, and `hypervisor` in #242. Re-check it against the file before
you present — a survey screenshot ages faster than anything else in this
run-sheet.

**`Hypervisor` has exactly one choice, and say so rather than skipping it.**
It is there because a *trigger* cannot pass a variable the survey does not ask
for — the portal launcher, and later ServiceNow, hand `extra_vars` to the
workflow, and a survey-enabled workflow rejects anything that is not one of its
own questions. The dropdown with one entry is the seam the other providers land
in, and it is honest about where the platform is today.

**`How many VMs` stops at 2, and that number is not arbitrary.** It was 10 until
#397. A `large` guest is 16 GiB against a 63 GiB budget, so three already
exceed it — eight of the ten values on offer had no outcome but being refused.
If someone asks whether they could have twenty, the answer is that the ceiling is
set where the hardware is, in six places that move together.

**This said "two questions" and showed an `os_type` dropdown until #300/#301.**
If your screenshot still has it, retake it. Removing it was not simplification
for its own sake: with one Terraform state per environment, choosing `windows`
in that dropdown set `create_linux=false` and planned the *running* Linux VM for
destruction. The operating system is now chosen by *which workflow you launch* —
`Linux Day 1 - 0 Workflow` or `Windows Day 1 - 0 Workflow` — and each owns its
own state, so neither can touch the other's VM.

**That is a better answer to give than the old one anyway**, because someone
always asks how you stop a self-service portal from letting a requester break
production. Here the answer is structural rather than procedural.

**And the portal is not hypothetical — show it if you have time (#242).** The
same workflow has a second entry point: `Self-Service - Request Linux Server`
in the self-service portal, which asks these four questions and fires *this*
workflow. Not a copy of it, not a portal-flavoured variant — the same object
you just launched from the Templates page.

> **"There is one implementation and two front doors. The engineer gets a
> Templates page; the requester gets a form. Neither is a re-creation of the
> other, so a fix to the chain reaches both on the same day."**

The wrapper exists for a dull reason worth naming if asked: the portal's catalog
syncs job templates and not workflows, so the entry point has to *be* a job
template. `playbooks/launch_workflow.yml` is that job template's whole
implementation — it validates the inputs and fires the workflow.

**Land the question that is deliberately missing.** There is no dropdown for
*which environment* — that is set per-controller from `connection.yml`:

> **"A dropdown for the target environment is one mis-click away from
> provisioning into the cluster you show customers. So it isn't a dropdown. The
> template in each controller is pointed at itself, and the playbook fails
> closed if the two ever disagree."**

That single design decision usually buys you more credibility with a sysadmin
than the rest of the demo combined.

---

## 8–16 · What happens behind the button

**Start on `ocp-vms-before.png`** — the empty namespace.

> **"That's where the VM lands. Nothing in it. Watch."**

**Then `aap-workflow-running.png`.** Five nodes, chained on success:

```
1 Provision → 2 Register → 3 Configure → 4 Compliance Scan → 5 Check
```

> **Screenshot is stale** — it was captured before the compliance node (#202)
> and before the #300 rename, so it shows four nodes under the old
> `Sales Demos - Build Demo VM` title. Retake it from a real run of
> `Linux Day 1 - 0 Workflow`. The chain above is what the workflow actually does.

Walk them in order. **Three beats matter here; everything else is detail.**

### Beat 1 — the Route 503s, and that is correct

**Show `route-503.png`**, or open the real URL if you have one.

> **"The second Terraform finishes, the URL exists and returns 503. That is not
> a bug — there is no web server yet. Infrastructure and configuration are two
> different jobs with two different failure modes, and this demo keeps them
> visibly separate."**

**Read the hostname out loud** — it encodes the story: the VM name carries the
tier that was requested, `-web` is the Service, then the namespace.

```
for u in $(terraform output -json web_urls | jq -r '.[]'); do curl -sI "$u" | head -1; done
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable     # after provision
HTTP/1.1 200 OK                      # after configure
```

**Come back and reload after configure.** 503 → 200 live is the best proof in
the demo.

### Beat 2 — the ordering you would not guess

> **"Register has to run before configure. Not for tidiness — the RHEL 9 boot
> image that OpenShift Virtualization ships has no package repositories at all.
> Every single `dnf` task fails on an unregistered guest. That's a five-minute
> debugging session the first time, and it's the entire reason this is one
> workflow instead of three buttons somebody launches in the wrong order at
> 9 a.m. in front of a customer."**

Source: `controller_workflows.yml:10-14`.

### Beat 3 — three different definitions of "done"

Draw this out loud; it is the most senior-sounding thing in the deck:

| "Done" | When |
|---|---|
| `terraform apply` returns | ~10 s |
| **The provision job goes green** | **36 s** |
| VM reports `Running` | ~45 s |
| sshd actually accepts a connection | ~1 more minute |

> **"Four answers to 'is it ready'. The provision job reports Success at
> thirty-six seconds while the machine is still booting — a green checkmark is
> not a usable server. A human learns that by getting Connection refused twice.
> The workflow just waits, and the gate lives in the playbook, so it protects
> the by-hand path too."**

### Close the loop — `ocp-vms-after.png`

Same view, one VM, `Running`, using the memory of the tier that was asked for.

> **"Nobody touched a console to make that happen."**

**If they spot `LiveMigratable=True`** and ask why you said no live migration:
that condition means the VM is *eligible* to migrate — shared storage, nothing
pinning it to a host. It has nowhere to go on a single node. Full wording in
[`objections.md`](objections.md#the-follow-up-then-why-does-it-say-livemigratabletrue).

### The numbers — show `aap-job-timings.png`

| Node | Duration |
|---|---|
| Provision VM | 36 s |
| Register Linux VMs | 4 m 25 s |
| Configure Linux VMs | 3 m 49 s |
| Check Linux VMs | 5 s |
| **Whole workflow** | **9 m 9 s** |

> **"Nine minutes nine. Building the machine is thirty-six seconds of it —
> the rest is registering and pulling patches."**

**Put the job list on screen rather than saying "about nine minutes".** Durations
in a controller's own job list are evidence; a presenter's estimate is not.

---

## 16–22 · What you get

Back to `demo-page-live.png`. Now walk the facts table and make the point that
**every value on that page came from the machine itself**:

- OS, kernel, vCPU/memory — gathered facts
- `small-1cpu-2gb → sd1.small` — the tier they asked for, resolved to the
  cluster instance type that served it
- **In-cluster address** — *"that's how AAP reached it. Plain ssh on 22, no
  bastion, no jump host, no agent."*

Then the three supporting artifacts, in this order:

**1. `facts.json`** — *"same data, curl-able, for the person who asks where the
page is getting it from."* (Full output in [`talk-track.md`](talk-track.md).)

**2. The login banners.** Show both, and make the contrast the point:

> **"Before you authenticate you get the legal notice — no branding, no product
> names, no URL, because you haven't proved who you are yet. After you
> authenticate you get this."**

Show the ASCII art. Let them enjoy the cow. Then:

> **"'This host is managed by AAP. Manual changes may be reverted.' That line is
> the whole operating model, printed where somebody about to do something manual
> will actually read it."**

**3. Cockpit** — installed and firewalled open on every guest. *"Because the
answer to 'what if I just need to look at the box' should be yes."*

---

## 22–26 · Why a sysadmin should care

Switch to the repo. Do not tour it — land four things:

1. **It is idempotent.** Re-running the CNV install reports `changed=0`. *"This
   is a converger, not a script that assumes it's going first."*
2. **The guardrails are in code, not in a wiki.** Ask for more memory than the
   node has and `terraform plan` **fails**. It does not leave you a `Pending` VM
   and a green checkmark. (`terraform/ocpvirt/locals.tf`)
3. **One implementation, two front doors.** The same playbook runs from a job
   template *and* from a laptop. The survey variable names, the skill's prompts,
   and the Terraform variables are literally the same strings — that is the
   contract.
4. **It cleans up after itself.** Nightly teardown at 6 PM America/Phoenix, on a
   schedule, and teardown deliberately *preserves* the expensive things —
   OpenShift Virtualization itself, the boot sources, the Terraform state.
   *"Cost control is a scheduled job, not a monthly reminder to go look."*

---

## 26–28 · The honest bits

Volunteer these. You will be asked anyway, and answering first is worth more
than answering well.

- **No live migration in this demo.** The lab cluster is a single node. CNV does
  live migration; this environment cannot show it. *"I'd rather tell you that
  than show you a slide about it."*
- **No live migration in this demo** (see above) is the only capability gap
  left in this list. **Windows used to be the second one and is not any more** —
  see the section below.

### Windows, if you are asked

**You can show it now, and this run sheet told you not to until #340.** The old
advice was "show the provisioning, not the guest, and do not open the console",
because a generalized image ignored the answer file we handed it and stopped at
the Windows OOBE screen. Three stacked bugs, all fixed and verified.

There is a **second, complete chain**, same shape as the Linux one:

```
1 Provision → 2 Patch → 3 Configure → 4 Compliance Scan → 5 Check
```

#### It takes about 15 minutes, and you must launch it before you start talking

**Windows is not Linux's 9 minutes and never will be.** Measured on sandbox:
roughly **15–16 minutes** for a cold build. About **6 minutes 30 seconds of that
is Windows first-boot after sysprep**, before Ansible can reach the guest at all
— specialize, oobeSystem, and standing up the WinRM listener. No amount of
automation shortens it. The full budget is in
[`docs/plan/ocpvirt-demo-plan.md`](../../plan/ocpvirt-demo-plan.md) →
*Windows demo performance budget*.

**So treat it exactly like the Linux workflow, only more so: launch it first,
then do the cold open while it runs.** Fifteen minutes of talking is a lot, so
plan for it rather than discovering it live:

- The sysprep wait is **good material, not dead air**. It is the one moment where
  "this is a real Windows Server doing a real first boot from a generalized
  image" is visible, and it is worth saying so instead of apologising for it.
- If you only have ten minutes, **run against a guest that already exists** and
  launch `Windows Day 1 - Repair` instead — same steps, no sysprep, about
  **7 minutes**. You lose only the provisioning beat.
- If you want the provisioning beat *and* the short demo, do both: show a clone
  starting (about **36 seconds** to `Running`) as its own moment, and run Repair
  against the guest you built earlier.

**The one difference is worth calling out rather than glossing**, because a
Windows admin in the room will notice it:

> **"On Linux, step 2 registers the guest to the Red Hat CDN — that image ships
> with no repositories at all, so nothing installs until it does. Windows has
> nothing to register; the golden image is complete. So step 2 is patching
> instead. Same slot, same job: get the machine entitled to content before you
> ask it to do anything."**

**The payoff is identical** — a Route that returns 503 until IIS serves, then
200. `web_url` resolves per-OS, so it is the same one command either way.


> ### The Windows compliance report is now safe to show
>
> Measured 2026-09-08: a clone of
> `win2k22-cis-l1-golden:20260908-1853` scores **26 of 27 controls compliant
> (96%)** — 0 non-compliant, 1 not configured. The hardening is real, it
> survives `sysprep /generalize`, and the guest carries it.
>
> Getting here took fixing three defects of one shape — a status trusted instead
> of the artifact measured (#364, image.builder.pipeline#92, #377). **The node
> that surfaced all of it is this one**, which is worth saying out loud if
> anyone asks why the number moved.

**The compliance node is where the Windows story gets better than the Linux
one.** There is no OpenSCAP for Windows, so it does not pretend to scan: it
reads controls back off the running guest and reports what the image
deliberately *does not* apply as documented exceptions, each with the file and
the decision behind it.

> **"Sixteen exceptions, and every one has a name against it. Fifteen are the
> image factory's — controls that would sever the very connection doing the
> hardening. The sixteenth is ours: we put a UAC setting back so automation can
> log in at all. That's on the report, in front of you, rather than in
> somebody's head."**

That usually lands better than a green tick, because it is the conversation a
security team actually wants to have.

**Do not claim the percentage is an audit.** It is over the controls the report
checks, and the report says so in words next to the number. If someone presses,
that honesty is the point — hand them `summary.json`.

- **`config.yml` always reports `changed`.** AAP returns one setting as
  `$encrypted$` on every read, so Ansible can never see it as converged. Known,
  cosmetic, documented.

---

## 28–30 · Landing it

Point at the footer of the demo page.

> **"That link is on the page the demo just built. Everything you watched —
> the Terraform, the playbooks, the workflow, the survey, the design notes for
> why it's built this way — is in that repository, in public, right now. Nothing
> I showed you is behind a login."**

Then pick **one** close and ask it directly:

- *"What's the first thing in your estate you'd point this at?"*
- *"Who else needs to be in the room the second time we do this?"*
- *"Would it be more useful to see this run live against your requirements?"*

---

## Running it live

If you have a warm environment, three beats change:

| Beat | Live version |
|---|---|
| 0–3 cold open | Launch **`Linux Day 1 - 0 Workflow`** *first*, then do the cold open on the screenshot while it runs. It needs ~9 minutes and you are about to spend 13 talking |
| 8–16 | Cut to the running job's output instead of the graph. Narrate the node that is actually executing |
| 16–22 | `curl -sI` the real URL, then open it. The 503 → 200 transition live is worth more than any slide |

**Check which environment you are on before you touch anything.** The sign-in
page is badged, and a pill sits in the masthead after login — green `SANDBOX`,
red `DEMO`:

![The badged sign-in page](../../images/aap-login-badged.png)

Green is the one you break. Red is the one the customer is watching.

**Then prove the environment is warm.** `/ocpvirt-new-env` builds and times a
real VM in about a minute and fails loudly if the cluster is cold.

**Keep the screenshot open in a tab regardless.** If the run stalls, do not
debug in front of them:

> **"That's a lab cluster doing lab cluster things — here's the run I did
> earlier."**

Cut to the tab and carry on. You lose nothing: the whole talk track is built to
work from the artifacts.

### Recovery moves

| Symptom | Move |
|---|---|
| **URL 503s but the VM says `Running`** | **Wait two minutes.** Most likely the VMI was re-created and the guest is still booting. The disk is persistent and httpd is `enabled`, so it comes back on its own — this was observed live, self-healing in about two minutes with no intervention. Narrate it as the "three definitions of done" beat rather than debugging it |
| URL **times out** rather than 503ing | **Not the cluster.** The router answers a bad route instantly with 503; a timeout means the connection never established, so it is your network path — VPN, proxy, wifi. Check whether the AAP or console tab also hangs |
| Job fails on `Error acquiring the state lock` | A cancelled run left a Lease held. Do not debug live — cut to the screenshot. The fix is in `playbooks/tasks/terraform_lock_check.yml` |
| Job fails with a 401, or times out then 401s | The RHDP token expired. Not fixable mid-demo. Cut to the screenshot |
| Register node runs long | Normal — it is 4–5 minutes of the nine. Fill with the "three definitions of done" beat |
| URL still 503 after configure | Check the guest firewall beat: firewalld on the VM is separate from the Route |

## Screenshots

The guest-facing artifacts render without a cluster. The AAP and OpenShift
interfaces cannot be rendered, so they were captured from a live run.

**Captured and wired in:**

- [x] The survey modal as a requester sees it — `aap-survey.png`
- [x] The workflow mid-run, nodes chained — `aap-workflow-running.png`
- [x] The namespace before and after — `ocp-vms-before.png`, `ocp-vms-after.png`
- [x] The badged sign-in page — `aap-login-badged.png`
- [x] The Route before the web server exists — `route-503.png`
- [x] Every node's real duration, all Success — `aap-job-timings.png`
- [x] The demo page served by a real guest — `demo-page-live.png`

**Still worth grabbing next time an environment is up:**

- [ ] The demo page **with the URL bar and padlock visible** — `demo-page-live.png`
      has no browser chrome, so the "real certificate, no cert management" point
      is still unillustrated. Minor; the page itself is captured
- [ ] `virtctl ssh` showing the pre-auth banner and the MOTD in one scrollback
- [ ] The AAP host detail page with cached facts
